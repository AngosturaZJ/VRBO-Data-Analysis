Some other small things were the following:- 1 drinking glass for two people- 1 washrag for two people, no hand towels- no bath mat for shower and it is slippery hardwood flooring- while leaving the property in the morning we were oddly stared at from the people upstairs.

The throw pillows were probably never washed and were torn. It wreaked of Marijuana. There was very outdated furniture and old squeaky, uncomfortable beds. The fridge was off and full of water. There were 2 towels. The tub was disgusting! My toddler took a shower and just walking around the room, her feet were black within minutes. The sink and the tub dripped all night. Most of the lights were burned out. There was 1 roll of tp. There were silverfish and roach traps and dead silverfish in the bathroom drawers. The ac didn't work. The pool was closed, probably because it was super dirty and had ducks floating in it. It was very loud, there were people yelling, fighting, and doing who knows what all night long.

Secondly if you expect the noise ordinance to be upheld by the renters then the owners should as well. There is no reason I should be woken up bulg what I can assume only to be as a morning ballet lesson followed by a fashion runway in cement heels. Next the bathroom while it is gorgeous definitely need to be looked at. The sink is entirely to small and there is a strange sewer smell that lingers in the bathroom. The internet was great on my devices but the TV is so old that it can't keep up with the wifi so watching anything that was streamed constantly buffered or flat out got stuck loading. Speaking of the TV half of the TV is darkened and will SOON be out. Next the lighting going down to the property is also dangerous there needs to be more closer to the door. The bamboo on steps needs to be trimmed back, I should not have to walk around it to use the stairs. Speaking of stairs, I understand it may not rain a lot in LA but it did when I was visiting and the most dangerous thing is wet wood as steps with no grip, they became dangerously slippery with how steep the steps are. Lastly a trash can NEEDS to be added, yes I know you have the tiny trash can big enough for receipts below the sink but that's clearly not enough.The Good : very beautiful neighborhoods. The furniture in the room was all very well crafted and clean. The studio itself was also very clean. The lighting in the apartment was very nice. The bathroom was very nice for a one person as well.

Overall the property was as advertised and we did enjoy our stay. The walk to downtown Playa was easy especially once we determined the shortcut. When we reached out to the host with questions, they were very responsive.  We did note several areas for improvement: 1) it is a steep set of stairs down to unit and handrail was covered with foliage, 2) light sensor was only at top of stairs; there should be one closer to the unit to illuminate the stairs at night, 3) the bathroom sink was extremely small-difficult to wash your face, 4) there was no place to hang up clothes so a rack would have been appreciated and 5) the quality of the mattress could be better as it was quite soft.', ': The studio was clean and in a great location.

It was raining while we were there so the hearty snacks really came in handy.', ""Charming home, good location, wonderful owner: To start, love the home, the owner Deb, and the neighbourhood.Myself and two boys travelled to LA just before Christmas and stayed here for 7 days. We wanted to stay in a neighbourhood that was close to the coastline and north beaches (Venice, Santa Monica, Malibu) but not too far away from the city (Crypto.com) and northern LA county (Universal Studios). This was the perfect spot for us. First, Deb is amazing. She's like a personal concierge. She had a snack tree for us with chips and cookies, stocked the fridge with some basics to get us going (milk, eggs, cream, water, drinks, yogurt, coffee) and provided us with a list of her favourite restaurants. The bathroom was the same, from shampoo, conditioner, body washes, toothpaste, and most importantly wonderfully smelling super soft towels (ask Deb for her secret). She was intent on making sure we had everything we needed. The kitchen while small works really well and is outfitted with excellent appliances and everything we needed (gas range, small dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker, nexpresso type of machine) . The suite is the upstairs of the home with separate access up a spiral staircase overlooking a cute backyard. It is spotless, bright, charming, and well suited to a couple or family of four with young kids and it also worked well for the 3 of us (boys are 17 and 20). Trees line the kitchen window but are cutoff at the perfect height to give you privacy but allow sunlight and blue sky in. There are two outdoor patio areas that are nice to sit on at different times of the day. The shower is awesome. What impressed me about the neighbourhood was how all the homes and yards are so well kept and this applies to other adjoining neighbourhoods. There is definitely pride in ownership. It's also strikingly quiet on weekends and weekdays. It feels really safe and families walked the streets after dark.For local restaurants we went to Akasha in Culver City for Californian cuisine (get reservations) and Paco's Tacos for authentic Mexican, which is just around the corner, was excellent. Lemonade on Abbott and Kinney is excellent for lunch. Yardhouse was decent but not great value, there are definitely better options. Other evenings we ate outside the neighbourhood.Locations we enjoyed that may not be on your radar: Zuma Beach and the drive up coast, 3rd street Promenade for shopping in Santa Monica, Abbot and Kinney boulevard for shopping and eating, and the Getty Villa.Thanks Deb!!!"", 'Absolutely amazing place and owner!: Deb is amazing and very helpful! She was very welcoming and informative and was there if we needed anything at all. The place is immaculate and was perfect for our family vacation to LA.

A+ all around.', ""Expected something more: Pros: secure property, not to far from things, easy check in, good communication with the hostCons: pics showed 2 full bathrooms but described 1.5 which was confusing; floors were dirty and our socks turned black; insufficient towels for our stay (no hand towels, 2 face clothes for 3 people, and 2 large towels per person), holes in the ceilings, a Do it yourself renovation that was very lacking (I know because I've flipped 5 houses), Kurig didn't work, No ice in the freezers, poorly stocked kitchen (who doesn't have a variety of sugars or powdered milk to have with coffee?). Also you could only do your hair upstairs because the outlet downstairs didn't take larger plugs that are standard on hairdryers.We under the impression this property was in West Hollywood but it was not. I don't know LA so maybe this one is my fault. Lots of noise at night from people on the street and in the neighborhood.Third house I've stayed in this year and the only one I wouldn't recommend especially with only one working shower for 4 bedrooms."", 'Central location with room: Lots of space here for a family, with very comfortable beds. Hollywood in walking distance. Host answered questions within an hour.', 'Spacious home.: Spacious home. Great location. Front door locks were a bit sticky and hard to open.

Stairs are steep.', 'Very nice place,clean,neighborhood in a very great location.I will chose this place again: I will love to rent this place if it is possible,I love the area', ""Great place great location: Really nice home, cozy, clean, nice amenities, great communication by owner. Close to good food spots and stores. The only thing to note is home located across from a film studio so pick a bedroom away from street side if you're a light sleeper."", ""Amazing Home: This property has everything! It is in the heart of Hollywood. We stayed to attend a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, which was a few minutes car ride. A mini market is in walking distance. Dee is an amazing and thoughtful host, she made sure we were able to check in with no problems and she checked on us to make sure we were good. She thought of everything, the pictures do not lie. We each had our own bedroom, the bathrooms are gorgeous (I'm a luxury bathroom kinda girl...lol). Having coffee of the patio was my favorite. Having a place to park was nice too, parking in L.A. is a bit problematic, so that was a plus. We will definitely put this on the list for next time. I visit L.A. yearly and since I sold my house there, this property will definitely be my home away from home. You will not be disappointed if you select this property.

There were plenty of comfortable surfaces to sleep on for the entire group of 15 people! The kitchen was cute and functional, the backyard was spacious and gorgeous, and the bedrooms were cozy. The only issue with this rental was the neighbors. There was a basketball hoop in the backyard so we decided to shoot around. The ball went over the neighbors fence and my friends went to ring the neighbors doorbell to see if we could get it back. The neighbors were unreasonably intimidated by my friends request for the ball back, so they complained to the host and threatened to call the police. The host was very understanding that the reaction was unreasonable and I really appreciated the way the host communicated with me about the situation. The host also explained that usually those neighbors don't have any issues with people staying in the rental.

Some cupboards stuffed with items, I'm not sure what for or why. There was a large hole in the living room wall partially covered with blue painters tape. This tape was also used on the screen door at eye level to show the screen when closed. Both sides of the house were filled with old objects such as broken furniture and ladder storage. These had been here so long the cobwebs were well established. One of the outdoor tables set up for use was broken.

We loved staying at this property and only wish this had been a longer trip as this property was so comfortable, from the layout, amenities, and the backyard fire feature. We are often in Los Angeles and will now look to book with Dylan before looking elsewhere for our future stays.', 'Spacious, comfortable and clean location for visiting family: Worked well for housing family attending a family gathering-- spacious with a well appointed kitchen. Nice big living room and patio to hang out. Meticulously clean.', ""Gorgeous plants; charming house: Our family of four loved our stay at this house. I enjoyed my morning coffee in the backyard even spotting a hummingbird drink from one of the amazing flowering plants all over this place. We had plenty of room even if grandma and grandpa could have joined us like planned. The evening s'mores by the fire pit was fun and easy win. As this house gets polished up some more on the inside stuff, it's going to be real gem on VRBO. I appreciated the practical amenities like coffee pot, tea kettle, iron, and washer and dryer. This house felt clean and I can tell this house is loved. Oh and great location! We easily drove to Universal Studios and Hollywood. The neighborhood itself is super cute. We headed to Ralph's grocery store and also an easy time with porch delivery. Lovely!"", 'Wedding Gown Shopping Experience: The home is lovely and the owner was responsive to our needs during the visit. The only recommendation I have is consider upgrading the mattresses. All bedroom mattresses were very firm- to the point- We went out and purchased foam mattress toppers during our stay at the property. Overall a good experience', 'Leaky ceiling drama: Where can I start. First, day of rental I had to ask for details to enter the front door. Messaged the management co at 10:30 am to get info. Responded quickly but I shouldn’t have had to ask. Place was nice but not fancy. 5 night rental- day 2 had major downpour. Roof leaked in one room onto comforter and carpeting. They responded quickly but didn’t clean the comforter or the carpet. 4 pots still on the floor and bed pushed against the wall. I asked for compensation for 3 nights of losing a room for 2 guests. We shut the door on that smelly musty room and never went in there again. We were offered a VERY small reimbursement. It did not represent losing the use of one room for more than half of our stay. Not happy at all. We will not come again.', 'Nice Place Good Location: Solid spot everything was as advertised good location went to Disneyland, Magic Castle and everything. Was clean and good space. Would stay there again.', ""Great location. A little tired: This property was in a great location. The house was a little tired and the outside space wasn't kept up very well but it was spacious, the backyard area was private, water pressure was great, plenty of warm water and very near a beautiful Ralphs grocery store, a Shopping mall, starbucks and plenty of restaurants. Appliances need some upgrading\\u002Ffixing. No Keurig but made a great pot of coffee. Plenty of towels and comfortable beds. Nice to park in the driveway and believe there is a tenant living above the garage but not an issue for us."", 'LA Family gathering: Overall the house description was accurate. The outdoor area was not as it was pictured in the VRBO description and the seating was not comfortable. The owner was extremely responsive and helped us to access the house after a check-in glitch. He also helped us access the living room TV. A written description of how to do that would be really helpful, for future reference. The house is well located and we were able to get to all of our family gatherings easily. It is spacious, and appeared clean and sanitized overall. We had a wonderful time!', 'Home away from home: This property is nice! Our house was getting fumigated and we needed a temporary place to stay. We also needed a place close to LAVC and this place fit the bill perfectly. It is in a very quiet neighborhood and was very peaceful. We had to bring our pets and this worked out great as it has a nice backyard that was fenced off that our dog could go to and not escape. FYI they have a cool fire pit with outdoor seating and BBQ. We did not use those amenities but they are a nice feature. We are locals so I wanted to say that if you are from out of town this would be a great place to stay if you wanted to go to Universal Studios and Hollywood.

Communication was property mangmt was excellent - easily accessible and responsive; we appreciated this. HOWEVER, upon walked in, the floor in the main room was dirty and the tv counter was dusty. I needed to use the bathroom as we had been driving for several hours. Walking into the bathroom, the towels were noticeably unorganized, appeared used, and just thrown on the shelf, half hanging and on the verge of falling. When the down toilet seat cover was lifted, there were yellow pee stains on the toilet seat; gross! I had to wipe it clean before usage. The floor of the bathroom was disgusting. There were pubic hair all around. Not just a couple strains, lots! We texted property mangmt. She was responsive and asked if we would like someone to clean it. We said yes, and left to grab dinner as the cleaning crew came by. The home was better upon arrival after dinner. However, there was a black used pair of socks left on the table next to the bed. There was also a pair of used gloves left in the shower. The first night was super noisy from the tenants of the main home. It appears they were a young family who had a hang out. They were playing music, singing, chit chatting, and playing board games until after midnight. In the morning, they were up early (7am) playing music - Sean Kingston Beautiful Girls. After the initiate first night, it was quiet and the main home appeared emptied. We stayed the duration of our time, as we just needed a place to rest our head. We wore slippers most of the time, so our feet wouldn’t touch the floor. The floor appeared fine after it was cleaned, but that initial observation made us feel icky.', 'Communication error: Our host sent us dos and don’t about the property, including instructions on how to buy a parking permit to park on the street. We were not able to buy a parking permit online, maybe need the computer instead of our phone. Go to the fire station and buy it from the machine. So obviously this is a good way to communicate. We waited for check in instructions. We sent a message on the app to our host at 1pm. Then another at 5pm. We finally called our host at 7:39pm for her to send us instructions to get in. We get to the house at about midnight, and there is parking in the driveway that is not being used. Why the hassle of the parking permit? Anyways, we get into the room and the windows are open. It was freezing in there. We closed the windows and tried to turn on the wall heater. We don’t have one so we thought we had it on. Apparently we didn’t no matter what we tried. We ended up sleeping in our sweaters and socks freezing all night. We would have been more comfortable sleeping in the car that we paid the parking permit for.

Even after opening all the windows\\u002Fdoors. Sitting on the balcony the dog poop from the neighbors balcony was visual and nasty. Nothing the owners could do about that(?) but it was none the less awful. A filthy sponge left on the sink so I wiped down the counters, sinks etc in case they were 'cleaned' with that sponge. Also the shower curtain was dirty and a stained wash cloth. The bed was very low to the ground. As an elderly person I was not able to get into the bed. Again not an issue that the owners would need to change, just something that a potential renter should be aware of. There was also some confusion about the amount of $$ I owed them. I paid them the extra they asked because they threatened to cancel our reservation and kick us out. I still believe they owe me $100 but they scared me. Parking stall was quite a walk for me. Marina was nice, traffic noisy. Overall the whole building was well kept with some nice seating areas. Would have given this a higher score had the owners not made me feel threatened.

I told the man (no name given) that I need check-in instructions and he asked which property. I gave him the address and he said he would send the instructions. He did not use the messaging system in the app, he texted me directly using a weird “number”: samirbilix@icloud.com. He said “here are directions” without attachment.

I then began hunting through all their correspondence and vrbo info. I texted and called them and they responded in about 15 minutes or so. The total delay in entering was about 30 minutes, which was not enjoyable after a long day of travel.Upon entering the unit, there were 3 circuit breakers turned off on the electrical panel; one of which powered the kitchen lights and the refrigerator. So it delayed me being able to make dinner me and my daughter. The search for the electrical panel was difficult and the panel ended up being in the bathroom above the toilet and hidden behind a painting. It was labeled with a blue piece of masking tape. I had to figure this out myself. There also was a cricket inside the unit that was cranking away during the night.

Our issues were with the property manager and their lack of communication. Everything was handled via messaging and our link for checkin didn’t work. Luckily we knew the door access code so could get in. Didn’t know for sure we had the correct unit though and didn’t want to try a door that wasn’t ours. Had to call the “emergency number” to make sure it was ok to use the door code. Someone was also parked in our assigned parking space when we arrived so we needed to know where to park. The person on the phone was nice, but didn’t have much access to information. Said we could enter the unit using the code and that they would pass along our message about the checkin link not working and no parking access. Several hours later we we told to go find street parking on our own. Luckily by then the person had moved their car and we were able to park. The area had outside gates with code access and since we couldn’t use the checkin link, we didn’t have gate codes. Wasn’t a problem when we arrived as the gate was propped open. Once we got back later that evening with groceries, the gates were locked and we couldn’t get in. Sent another message asking them to please respond asap with the code. Several hours then passed again before they responded. Then didn’t give the code, simply said they hoped we had been able to get into the unit by then. Luckily another resident came out of their unit and gave us the code. If not, we’d still be outs', 'Great: Great time at this spot with my girlfriend. Didn’t like how difficult it was at first to find the spot but everything else was perfect', 'Perfect location: It was the perfect place to be near the beach, restaurants and bars.

I can be available or respectful of your privacy - as you  need. I have helped many of my guests plan their trips with great success. Or if you prefer, we may not even see another. My schedule is busy with kids, business & frequent traveling. Of course, anything you need I will make happen quickly regardless of where I am on any given day.Neighborhood overviewWe love our safe, friendly, working-class, hillside Latino neighborhood. Please NOTE - this is not a trendy/hip area, if you like to be in the heart of clubs, exclusive restaurants & bars - check out West Hollywood, Silverlake, or Downtown LA. If you want a convenient, safe place to serve as your base, if you like quiet, if you like to see how the people of the city really live if you like the convenience of being a couple minutes from 4 different freeways - you will be happy here. The neighborhood consists mostly of families that have lived here for 3 generations. A block downhill is the main street - consisting of 2 small markets (fresh fruits & veg, milk, eggs, cereal, meat), a local 99 cent store, a traditional Mexican bakery, a couple liquor stores (mostly beer & liquor), the library is the yellow building on the corner & of course the neighborhood Catholic Church. City Terrace Park is 4 blocks away. Great park with jungle gyms, climbing sculptures, grassy hills & a giant splash pad. There are always tons of kids running around. If you like to visit a place & see how the people actually living there live - you found your spot. FOOD - There is a great Mariscos (seafood) truck that parks in front of the church during the day. At night you can get super tacos, tortas (Mexican sub sandwiches) & quesadillas, there are 2 competing street taco stands to choose from. The ice cream truck passes every night & if you hear a young lady walking the streets yelling about 9:30am it’s fresh homemade tamales they are $1.50-$2 each & they make a great, convenient lunch! If you prefer to eat at a restaurant check out El Tepeyac for the burritos. I moved to LA from Oaxaca, MX - the birthplace of mole & the mole at Moles La Tia is the best around! El Gallo Grill is the nicest of the local restaurants. For vegetarians ask them to make you the roasted veggie tacos - they aren’t on the menu & they are amazing. We love the tacos at Guisado's & that's good because they only serve tacos. We are located just minutes 7-10 from Downtown by car, closest to the Arts District & Little Tokyo. It's easy to get to the Convention Center (E3) & LA LIVE for concerts. Downtown LA is vibrant with new clubs, bars & world renown restaurants. USC MEDICAL CENTER - 5 minutes by car from the hospital & we host many residents/interns, visiting Docs & patients. CAL STATE LA - 3 blocks away GOLF - 5 minutes away from Monterey Golf course and Montebello Golf course. DODGERS - 10 minutes by car from the stadium and you can see the Friday night fireworks from the dining room window! LAKERS - 10 minutes away from tip off by car. POKER - 12 minutes away from the COMMERCE CASINO by car. HOLLYWOOD BOWL & GREEK THEATER - 30 minutes away (10 miles) BEACH - 45 minutes (19 miles) DISNEYLAND & CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE - 35 minutes (23 miles) UNIVERSAL STUDIOS - 30 minutes (14 miles) BEVERLY HILLS - 40 minutes (17 miles) THE GETTY - 45 minutes (22 miles)Getting aroundWe recommend using a car to get around unless you are planning to visit only a small geographic area in which case UBER/LYFT will serve you fine. If you are a new user download the UBER app & use ima09 for a $25 credit.  The LYFT app is the same and HESA13 will get you a $10 credit. If you wanted to take the bus - there are someplaces it makes sense like to a Dodger game. The bus stops on the corner & offers straight service to Downtown LA. If you get off at Union Station (Downtown) it is a transit hub - meaning you can catch the subway, or take the Amtrack train throughout CA. Car - if you bring a car - free, unrestricted street parking. We suggest making the most of your trip to LA by having access to a car. You will also need a GPS APP with TRAFFIC notifications, our favorite is WAZE. In LA, it's not how many miles away something is but how long it takes to get there. Traffic is intense, be prepared for it, breathe & know that you'll eventually get there - enjoy the ride!View more",House,['LABEL_2']

The location was good--walking distance to Melrose Street and Santa Monica Avenue. There was a place for parking, although it was a tight squeeze and I would suggest having a smaller car. The kitchen was fine, with relatively new appliances. The shower was great--nice and strong. The bed was comfortable and clean.When we arrived and walked in, it was warm and humid. The stench of cat was awful. There was only an air conditioner in the living room that did not reach down the hall to the bedroom. Underneath the air conditioner was a wall that looked like it had been repaired from a leak and was not painted over. When we contacted the owner about the air, he answered quickly and said he would add a portable in the bedroom. That helped considerably and kept things cool and the cat odor down. Wet linen had been placed in the drier and were moldy, which was also rectified.There was no welcome package to greet us (although his wife\\u002Fpartner said she would leave one), so we did not know how to use the TV, stove or livingroom air conditioner. The person who came by with the new air conditioner helped us with our questions. Eventually, we were able to watch programs and cook.There were very few amenities. No lamps in the livingroom. I'm glad we brought extension cords.I believe that this was an apartment that was quickly put up for Vrbo without giving it much thought. If we had not objected to the situation, it would remain the way it was when we came in. I would check it out or have someone check it out before staying there...again, the cat smell was awful--and I've had cats. We have stayed in LA numerous times and have many places to compare for the same price. This was a disappointing. Since the location is very central and safe, the owner could do some repair work on the place and it would raise his rating considerably.""]",3.0,,los angeles california,"[""1.

There is not a pull-out sofa, nor are there two side chairs, and the coffee table is very scratched up. We could not find a dishwasher and the refrigerator was difficult to access. The worst thing was the dishes were not clean--the one wine glass had dried red wine in it and smudges on it, yet was placed with the other glasses in the cabinet.

The king bed guest room is down some exterior stairs and as mentioned, it's not for mobility impaired individuals. If you have a group with someone staying there, plan on sharing one of the bathrooms in the main house until they retire to their room. We definitely wanted to make as few trips as possible up and down. Really just a convenience thing, it wasn't that treacherous for us. Some of the instructions could be updated to be a little more clear like the spa remote location and use. Apparently you can also install an app to control the spa, but you need model and device numbers to setup an account, which we could not find. We did manage to use the remote and also found the outside physical buttons mentioned so we had a backup way to turn it off if the remote batteries died (battery low was flashing on the remote).

The room isn't heated so having the plug in heater all night was loud and a bit unnerving. If you have ANY mobility issues this is not the house for you. We ascended and descended the stairs only once a day which made the room less than desirable. If it was raining, this room would be a no go as the stairs are not covered and would get muddy.

MDR and Venice are quite different.Photos of what we had reserved show a modern, beautiful open plan high-end kitchen and living space. We had intended to host dinners at home and enjoy time with our LA college son and LA niece. The kitchen where we actually stayed was a galley kitchen. Not the vibe we were after. As a result, all dinners were eaten out at much greater expense – it’s LA.Bathrooms were not comparable to the high-end bathrooms shown for the reserved property.

The master bedroom has only two foot-pedal light fixtures which require one to get in and out of bed to turn on\\u002Foff. No side tables with lights or to place cell phone, glass of water, book, etc. Host spouse did not walk us through the apartment or the complex to provide instructions about basic details. Did not hear from him again until after we finally received WIFI and pool towels. “Where’s the pool?” -he sent us a message with a link to a “Nestin site” with a video of a person walking a maze of hallways and parking lot – not what we reserved. Notably, Nestin had details for checkout, including responsibility for washing the towels – glad I clicked each link. Disappointment notwithstanding, we followed the instructions and left the apartment impeccably clean, including washing the towels, stripping sheets, taking out all of the trash, etc. We also left a generous tip for the cleaning crew as the issues are not of their making.What this really comes down to is the benefit of the bargain – our expectations were based on the photos we saw; we paid for something that we did not get. We were left disappointed and out far more money than planned given the lack of open plan, high end kitchen, expected amenities and service. We tried to resolve these things with the host with a reasonable solution - unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in doing so.', 'Stay: Very nice...', 'Great location abs amenities: Property was well kept and beautiful.

There were only 5 towels, enough for one per person our entire weekend stay. No trash cans in any of the bathrooms. You had to go up the stairs to throw your trash away in the kitchen trash. There was only one key, and with it being gated, the rest of my party had to call me to get them if they were trying to get back into the condo.

The booking process and arrival were seamless and the home was exactly what we had hoped for in being able to provide space for 11 of us to stay. There were pros and cons that I want to mention.Pros: 1. Cleanliness. For the most part the home was clean and orderly. Towels and bed linens were clean and the rooms were tidy and welcoming,.2. The beds were comfortable.3. The host communicated well and made check in\\u002Fout smooth.Cons: 1. The home had clearly undergone some work inside which was poorly done. Paint covered all the outlets and light switches and was sloppy. 2. Peel and stick flooring was installed with grout that wasn't necessary and was not cleaned off of the floors. 3. The dishwasher was not working, which we found out the hard way. A line was disconnected and water flowed everywhere. The drain spout on the sink overflowed all over the counters.4. The downstairs bathroom had a broken shower head and the toilet leaked. A bowl had been placed under the leaky line. It had to be emptied multiple times a day to prevent overflow onto the floor.5. With all the rain we had the weekend we stayed there, water began flowing in under the front door. We had to place towels under the door to keep it from continuing to pour in. There was evidence of water damage around the base of the door.6. We were told not to leave food out as it may attract ants. We kept all food in the fridge or in cabinets but still woke up to ants in the kitchen.7. The showers had mold.8. The frame around one of the kitchen windows was broken, separating from the glass, breaking the seal and allowing outside air to come in.9. The doorknob to the door on the master bedroom water closet was broken and kept coming off. You could not lock the door.10. There wasn't enough dishes for even 6 people. The kitchen was very unorganized.All in all, we were together and we were mostly comfortable, but work needs to be done to improve the property and make it worth its cost. Other things we noted but aren't necessarily a con is the living room had just a small couch and a chair, which made it hard for all of us to be together. We had to pull chairs from the kitchen, which was not comfortable. There was also no TV in the living room.

Budget group stay. Huge loft☀️.,39,1.0,1.0,4.0,3,2 bedrooms,1,6,278,"['Don’t recommend: First off we were told to ignore VRBOs emailed instructions and instead got instructions texted to me the day of. It would have been nice to know check in instructions a little farther in advance since we had to go to a different location to pick up the keys off of a random street post that had a lockbox on it. The neighborhood and street area was disgusting. We were told to tell the security and front desk that we were “staying with a friend” and to not mention VRBO which was very odd. Our key fob also did not work for the first day we were there and we had to get it replaced. When we checked in we stood outside for over 30 minutes trying to get in the building. Turned out that that key didn’t even belong to that building. We were also told there would be a key fob and 2 metal keys - fob to enter the building, one key for our place and one for the rooftop access. We only had 1 metal key and I told them that vía messages so I thought we didn’t have rooftop access since we didn’t have the key. And even though it technically was a 2 bedroom I was a little angry that we were not told the bedroom were open, they had no doors on them, which I feel could have been better described. The floors were very dirty and sticky. We were unable to walk around without shoes or socks on. There was a used condom sitting on the outside window seal. The WiFi also did not work well the entire time we were there even after messaging the owner and stating so he just kept saying that it was working fine. The only thing on the “smart tv” that we could bring up was Netflix and that took rebooting the tv and reconnecting the WiFi to it multiple times.

The kitchen chairs were very wobbly & one chair couldn’t be used as it had a broken leg. Install about 12 hooks on the block wall out by the pool so that swim suits & beach towels could be hung outside after using the pool. A robot vacuum for the pool would be ideal for keeping the pool clean at night while everyone sleeps, a lot of silt was in the bottom of the pool which got stirred up once everyone got in it, which required goggles for everyone in my group because of the eye irritation. Lots of large cockroaches in both bathrooms every day of our stay. The backyard astroturf had lots of real grass growing up under it that had not been managed as it was overgrown. The lamp in the twin bedroom was missing the switch to turn it on & off. Better lighting in every room should be revisited. Ceiling fans in every room as well as under the outdoor Lana’i area would be an asset to future guests.

Here you will find:- Propane BBQ Grill- Fire Pit- Lounge Chairs- Smart LightsSMART LIGHTSYou  can control the lights in the backyard by downloading the Smart Life app and pairing your phone with the lights via the WIFI. FIRE PITYou can use the fire pit in the backyard but you will need to buy firewood which you can pick up for a couple dollars at the Smith's grocery store less than a mile away. There is lighter fluid and a long lighter in the cabinent to the right of the microwave in the kitchen.BBQ GRILLFeel free to use the grill, but please clean (ie: scrape) it off and replace the grill cover after you're done and AFTER IT COOLS DOWN. Otherwise the wind might knock it over. There are grilling utensils in the drawer to the right of the over. SMOKING / VAPING / 420ING- YES, you may vape anywhere inside the house. There is also a vape shop across the street called D's smoke shop. Just be sure the oil doesn't stain anything because I know that stuff is a pain to deal with.- YES, you may smoke weed inside the house IF you are running the fan or have the windows open. There is also a dispensary across the street where you may legally purchase weed with any valid U.S. ID or driver's license from ANY STATE. - YES, YOU MAY SMOKE CIGARETTES OUTSIDE IN THE BACKYARD.

You'll also find an Oculus Quest 2 VR Headset loaded with dozens of games. Try it out, especially if you've never used one before! NOTE WHEN USING THE OCULUS VR HEADSET - As soon as you turn the headset on, you will be asked to create a boundry. I strongly recommend setting a SMALL and conservative boundry, because I have personally punched holes through walls, TVs, and all sorts of things while playing VR. Not only will it hurt your hands, it will hurt your wallet if you need to replace anything you break. Guests can feel free to make purcharges both on the VIZIO TV and the Oculus Quest  2 and will be billed for their purchases after checkout. MASTER BEDROOMA spacious, sprawling, and sexy room that may or may not be the highlight of your Vegas Vacation. I feel like I should warn guests about the bed in the master bedroom... It can be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS because it is so comfortable, you relaxing, and so luxurious that you may feel yourself drifting off into sleep from the moment you feel the cushy memory foam propping you up and you will never want to get out of bed again. Imagine what it feels like to sleep on a cloud full of down feathers. That's about10% of what this bed has to offer. NOTHING compares!The is mood lighting underneath the bed that can be controlled by downloading the WIZ app and pairing your phone to the smart lights. All bathrooms are stocked with the basic necessities. GUEST ROOM (AKA ""The Lavender Room"")A cozy 175 sqft room with a memory foam queen sized bed fit for two. The window overlooks the park outside.

When I got in contact with the owner and vrbo they simple called me a lair and that I don't know what I am talking about even though I produced evidence to them. I ended up staying in my vehicle overnight on hold with vrbo. Obviously because of the police situation.

This place is amazing.: The pictures don’t do this place any justice. It is incredible! The bathrooms are studio apartments they are huge. Safe parking garage and easy check in. Awesome pool and great amenities. The owner is the best and easy to get ahold of. The only con I have is we forgot a bottle of Crown Royale in the freezer. If it’s available I’ll stay here again 100%', 'Not nearly as nice as the pictures.: The condo was plenty big but had plenty of problems. First of all the building itself is dated and needs major remodeling. The unit had sketchy air conditioning which worked somewhat the first day but never really worked very well after that. There was no water from the kitchen sink and two of the three TV’s didn’t work. There was no over lightning in the bedrooms, only table lamps. No lights in the closets. All maintenance is performed by the owner, there is no on site maintenance people. Major disappointment.', ""Very clean and close to LV Strip: Property was very clean and overall quiet. The pool was a big hit with our family. Linens were great quality and both bathrooms had luxurious tubs and plenty of towels. Debated between 4-5 stars and chose 5 because of overall experience. It is important to note the parking garage is stairs only and parking on the ground floor was difficult to find depending on the time of they day we parked. For those with mobility challenges the parking may be tough. Our first night (Saturday check-in) was multiple trips up six stairwells (three flights). The kitchen was well appointed but completely devoid of any spices for cooking, glasses (there were some plastic cups), and had only a few plates. As we typically eat out often in LV the lack of dishes and cooking materials was not really a problem and I'm mentioning it for your planning purposes. If you are expecting to cook and eat in the kitchen you will need to plan accordingly. That said, the property is in a great location near many food choices. About a 5 minute to the LINQ where there are dozens of eating choices and lots to choose from. Pool was clean, welcoming, and the Jacuzzi was great after a long flight. We would have spent more time in the pool if possible. Pool hours are 10 AM to 8 PM. Early pool closure was a double edged feature. Great that the property was quiet and we could enjoy the spectacular view from the balcony at night (which we did every evening) in peace without pool noise. Our boys (18, 16, 13) would have preferred longer pool hours but it worked out well for everyone. We will definitely stay again if the property is available on our next visit."", '60th Birthday!: Convenient to the other casinos are awesome! Cleaning the tubs and the cooking range needs extra tender loving care (TLC). The sliding door by the kitchen tile needs decreasing. Difficult to open and the knob was broken.

Would highly recommend!', 'It’s the Venetian: Great suite for a group.', ""Beautiful Oasis in a Crowded & Chaotic City: The property was beautiful, luxurious, and very clean. Our family of five enjoyed the generous living rooms for each bedroom and elegant and high end bathrooms. The beds were super comfortable. I have one comment and one critique, the latter which I suspect is the fault of the Venetian and not the owners. Comment: this room is not a 2 BR suite as described in the text of the posting but rather two separate rooms connected by a door. The pictures, however, do accurately reflect the suite layout, and the connecting door was no issue for us - my husband and I quite liked being able to shut our teens on the other side. The Critique: we were told at the Venetian check in desk that if we so much as picked up the water bottles and other food items left out and about that we would automatically be charged. Likewise if we removed anything from the fridge to make space for our own items. I asked if the Venetian could simply remove all these items so that we wouldn't accidentally pick up a water bottle (apparently they are weighted in some way) and could use the fridge. I was told that if they did so, we would be charged a $150 restocking fee. For the prices we are paying, this is ridiculous.I actually have one other comment on the Venetian and another on Vegas. Although the pools at the Venetian are lovely and numerous, none of them are what my children consider \\"", 'The Venetian: There were no refrigerators available in the room for guest use. Our shower in one of the rooms did not drain. There were 6 towels for 10 guests. They did not clean rooms and there were no linens for the pull out couch. We had to call housekeeping for more towels and the linens', 'Overall, a good stay: The property was overall great. The check in process was smooth, and location can’t be beat. However, one of the rooms smelled like rotten food (almost like eggs or a dead mouse). The other room was odor free. Luckily, we weren’t in the room much or I would have contacted the manager, but I would recommend identifying this issue and correcting it. Multiple of my guests also smelled it.', 'Amazing Stay: We will be back. Great host and arrangement.', 'Great stay: Everything was perfect!', 'Easy and worth it!!: I checked in at 3pm with no wait for the rooms at all. The conjoined rooms are so worth it! I had 9 girls total and it worked well. I’ve stayed at the Venetian before and it’s always amazing.

The furniture is dirty and scruffy and NOT like photos. There is not enough seating comfort seating for amount of bedrooms. The beds are definitely not luxury as stated and actually falling apart. The bed linen was clean but the cheapest possible options and I won’t mention the pillows feel free to be that judge! We had a cockroach in a bedroom but once killed we saw no more, and something to consider which I missed on booking…. This property sleeps 7 easy but the master has one bath leaving only one bath for 6+ people, this is a nightmare plus we ran out of hot water. The property does state 2 bath so I missed this but definitely needs to be considered.', 'Big place, pet friendly: It is super hard to find a nice pet friendly place in Vegas.I love how big the yard was for my dog to run around. There was a little playground for my little one to play with too. Came in October and it was too cold to swim but the pool did not look too bad. Property was super big so it was comfy. I wish the place was a bit cleaner. The bathrooms did not seem as clean but everywhere else was good!Would recommend. Might stay again.', 'Wedding Party: This was our first stay at a VRBO listing and i highly recommend this listing and others that this host has to offer, there are many choices out there and i do believe we got what we were looking for.

We were a part of 8 with small children, teens, and my elderly parents. There was ample space for everyone without feeling crowded. The basketball court was a nice addition.Cons: there was not enough seating for everyone. The couch was small and only sat 3 small people. All of the furniture and dining chairs in the home was uncomfortable. The dishwasher and garbage disposal did not work. As soon as I walked in the house I could smell the stench of old food\\u002Fgarbage from the sink\\u002Fdishwasher. The entire place was not cleaned well and the bathrooms were gross. We cleaned prior to using the bathroom and still used shower shoes in the shower. The washer had mold in it. The pool was freezing and had sticks and debris in it so we didn’t use that. There was not enough wash clothes and towels so we had to go out and purchase the items. I’m not from the area but the neighborhood didn’t seem too safe so we were constantly checking doors at night since the gates were almost ready to fall over and had holes in them. One gate wouldn’t even stay closed because the wind kept pushing it open. Long story short we won’t stay here again.', 'Great place to stay: This space was everything we hoped for and more.

Day 2 after coming back to the house there were 2 house roaches in the bathroom of the master bedroom and one in another bedroom. My husband killed them, we decided not to make a big deal over 3. Sunday we left for the day arrived back to the house, turned the lights on to find roaches scattering from under the couch, on the walls and counters and in the plastic food containers and stove, in our shoes left on the floor and rooms. This is not acceptable. Contacted the owner who said they were unaware of roaches and would take a look the next day. There is no way that this could not have been known. The raid apparently stopped working by the 3rd day. We could not even get an apology from the owner. In addition, the listing states the house was renovated which is definitely not accurate. The walls were dirty, pillowcases had yellow staining, the front bedroom did not have an air vent, toilet paper holder and shelf under the tv were hanging off the wall. This house needs a lot of work and should be fumigated prior to renting out on VRBO.', ""A breath of fresh air in Paradise: I must say that this property was everything I needed.

Everything was as described and had everything we needed for our stay.', ': This guest did not leave a written review.', 'Great Neighborhood and Stay: Me, my partner, and our 3 year old stayed here for a weekend getaway. The neighborhood is great - quiet, seemed safe and family-friendly. The apartment was as described, clean and in good condition. The space felt a bit damp (presumably as its a basement apartment) but not terrible. I do wish there had been an outdoor seating area of some kind to sit and enjoy the weather (while it lasts!) but not a deal-breaker. Off-street parking was GREAT to have, and access to the L was simple (Blue Line less than a mile South of the rental, Green Line less than a mile North). The local restaurants were good, and it was nice to not have to drive anywhere to grab a bite to eat or a few groceries. Overall I recommend this location for those visiting the Windy City.', 'Nice Place!: Very nice neighborhood and very cute place.', 'Great place to stay for trip to a Cubs Game: Our family stayed here when we went to a couple Cubs games. Safe neighborhood and clean and comfortable apartment. Property manager was quick to reply to any questions or requests we had. We will try to stay here again next time we watch the Cubs.', 'Great location: Wonderful stay!

Staying here is the very definition of “hassle-free”. I fully intend on renting this property again the next time I am in Chicago.', ""Working in Oak Park: I spent an extended stay in Oak Park in this spacious studio apartment for work. The location was perfect. It's in a safe neighborhood and I was able to freely walk to work and the downtown area. There was an accumulation of snow one day, and everything was cleaned off nicely. The bathroom and kitchen were very nice. The apartment had everything that I needed to get by for more than two weeks. I loved having a code to get in all of the doors, without having to deal with a set of keys. I did leave one day and forgot to lock it, not realizing that you needed to put in the code again to lock it, but that was my fault. I assumed that it locked on its own and didn't verify that before I left. I would say that my only complaint would be the apartment noise and the heat. The heating was a little tricky, as the thermostat was hard to understand. I didn't bother the owner with this, but it did take me a while to find how I could get some heat to the apartment. Maybe a little pamphlet or instruction guide would be great for other renters. The noise was a little hard to get used to. The laundry room is right outside of the kitchen and if someone is doing laundry throughout the night it can be a bit noisy. People were running up and down the stairs and then the opening and shutting of the washer and dryer doors. It can be a little frustrating. Also, the noise from the apartment above me kept me up through the night on more than one occasion as well. If you are from Chicago and have lived in other apartments, this is pretty normal, but I haven't had neighbors in a really long time, and it was a little difficult to get used to. This wouldn't keep me from staying again, because I do know that every apartment that I lived in while in Chicago is pretty much the same way.Overall it was a great stay. Thanks, Anne!"", 'Quaint Studio: located in an established neighborhood with tree lined streets, near restaurants and close proximity to the freeway, we loved the feel of this studio with a full kitchen.

A very late, cold, and dark arrival to a boat we’d never frequented was made a little more challenging when we had to locate and switch on the breakers (thank you to my handy, handsome, hero and my hubby, Shaun). Once we could light the dark hull and get heat started (54 degrees to a Floridian is freezing!) we were quite comfortable. Having a mother who sold her home to live and travel in an RV came in handy when figuring out the toilet and shower pumps (AND which breakers to turn off so as not to trip the macerator pump). A little more instruction would’ve come in handy but my husband and I are resilient and fairly easy to please. Due to the soft rocking of the boat, overcast skies, and walking tours of Boston we slept like babies. We would book this Do-Little boat again so don’t let this post make you assume otherwise.', 'Great stay with DoLittle: Booked Do Little for a quick overnight adventure in the North End and had a great time.

The second biggest problem was that the place is advertised as having air conditioning. There was a portable AC unit which did nothing more than provide a fan--the compressor never really worked and did not cool the apartment. It was also so loud that you could not have it on and watch TV at the same time. The bathroom had a sewage odor and we could not make it go away. The kitchen is oddly configured, and as a result, the refrigerator doors do not open all the way. There was no oven, just a small toaster oven. In order to access a stovetop you would have to remove a big microwave and a huge block of wood. The stove was hidden underneath.

But that’s about it: It was clean and The location was amazing! That was about it. There were a few things I did not care for at this location. It is in their basement, which is fine! The noise policy is from 9pm-7am. They were up and noisy in the mornings before 7. It states a light breakfast like yogurt but there was only 3 yogurts for 5 people for 3 days. So that was disappointing. I also noticed they had their own personal food and freezer in the kitchen space. I was disappointed they had been in the basement while we stayed there. We left and came back and they had moved food around in the fridge. Same fridge as where they had the yogurt for us. So that is how I knew they were in there. I think they need to stay out of the space to respect their guests privacy. I think for these reasons it is overpriced. I also got charged for an extra person, roughly $100 more due to an “extra person” but I don’t understand that because it slept 6 people and we had 5. I asked about it and never got a response back. You are also told you get half the driveway but one of the days they had painters there and we had to park in the street. It wasn’t ideal, especially when you’re told differently and pay for such things. No, I would not stay here again.', 'Quiet & Safe Neighborhood: This is a nice basement apartment in a cute neighborhood with fun patio use!', 'Salem\\u002FBoston trip: Location is perfect!

We felt like we were in the city without being in the middle of downtown. Cute neighborhood, was very safe, clean, and mostly friendly. This is a great little apartment that is near enough to Fenway to walk (1.5 miles) or get an Uber elsewhere relatively quickly. Amenities in the apartment were nice, but it was supposed to have a Keurig and only had a brew coffee maker. Also, it did not have a wine bottle corkscrew anywhere. These were minor inconveniences overall, and the remainder of the apartment was nice and clean with the exception of the air intake and output vents, they were filthy! Also, one small fan in the smaller bedroom was broken, but the one in the master was fine (but also dusty). The place slept 5 adults quite comfortably and was clean otherwise. I would certainly stay here again if the occasion arose. Great management too!', 'Brookline Treasure!: The perfect condo right in the heart of Brookline! More than enough room for four adults with a cozy and comfortable living space and bedrooms. Well appointed and stocked kitchen and bathroom. All within walking distance to everything and anything you could want or need--great restaurants, shopping, public transportation, etc...all right outside your door step. Wonderful and prompt communication with Alma from the Property Mgmt Team. The welcome basket of treats was a sweet gesture too!', 'Great location: Great, fun location in a very liberal neighborhood with tons of choices for food, coffee, shops. Big old houses were fun to pass by and sidewalks are everywhere making the walks to and from the apartment safe and easy. Train station right there. Easy to walk anywhere and an easy ride to downtown Boston. The apartment is above a great restaurant and is very comfortable and had plenty of room even for five people. It is on a fairly busy street so it gets a little noisy at night with cars\\u002Femergency vehicles but it’s pretty minor and did not affect sleeping at all. Master bedroom is very comfortable. Neighborhood is safe and peaceful. Police department a block away. We really enjoyed our stay here and the host was very helpful and communication was great. Host helped us secure overnight parking which was key. Definitely highly recommend this place whether a family or a couple.', 'Fenway Park trip!: We stayed here during our trip Boston to visit historical sites and see a couple of games at Fenway. Easy access to the T(public train) to get most places you would want to go and only a couple of stops away from Fenway. Parking is limited and so we paid for their space which was a few blocks away. Probably a 10-15 walk for us both ways, but we were able to find street parking when loading and unloading. I would definitely stay again.', ""Nice apartment in a great location: The apartment was clean and well stocked. There was a welcome basket in the kitchen with water bottles and snacks that were much appreciated after our long flight. We didn't do any cooking, but the kitchen looked like it had everything you'd need. The bathroom was large and had a basket with soaps, razors, shaving foam, toothbrushes, etc. Our group was 3 women and there was plenty of room for all of our lotions, hair supplies, etc. The living room couch was comfortable and there was plenty of room for all of us. The bedroom above the street had a king sized bed. The mattress was too firm for my liking. The street is very busy and if you are a light sleeper, this is not the room for you. Buses, delivery trucks, and even an occasional siren could be heard. My daughter slept in the other bedroom and said it was quiet, but the mattress was too firm for her. There is no elevator, but I am 60+ years old with a brace on a bum knee and had no trouble going up and down the stairs. The apartment was smoke free, but when we went into the hallway, we could immediately tell that someone had been smoking in the hall\\u002Fstairwell. We had paid for a parking space, but when we arrived someone else was parked there. I had to call the owner and ask that the car be removed. The owner emailed a detailed welcome packet with a ton of information. It included pictures of specific things to help us easily get into the apartment and find our parking spot. The apartment is very close to a T station. We felt very safe walking from the T station back to the apartment at night. Also, the apartment is very close to Starbucks and other coffee shops, a convenience store, and restaurants. Brookline is a cute town and a nice place to stay."", 'We had a few issues but the management worked to resolve all issues. They responded well.: Very accommodating.', 'College tours: Great location, we had a car because of our out of area college tours, I would however avoid that in future. Parking spot is definitely handy but a hike, a car not necessary if you are staying within Boston. Apt was perfect for 3 of us. Main bedroom has a very very firm mattress.

Enjoyed our stay.', ""Wedding Week: Had the family with me for my niece's wedding. House was perfect size, close by venue, easy access to Boston and surrounding areas!"", 'Great space for families or larger groups!: Overall the space is great for a family! The location is just 15 minutes outside of Boston which is nice to get away and be in a more quiet location. One thing that was a bit of a struggle was the parking. There are 3 parking spaces and the one for this specific unit is in the corner so when the other two spots are filled, it makes for a difficult entrance and exit especially if you have a bigger suv. Should be fine if you have a small car. Also, ladies bring a mirror! The only mirrors were in the bathrooms, would be nice to have one in each of the rooms. The water pressure in the middle restroom is VERY strong, some may like it but definitely might be a little to rough to shower younger kids. Beside those few minor things, this was a great space and I will definitely book again when coming back to Boston!', 'Beautiful, spotless home!: Parking is tight, as it is all around the area, but you have an assigned space! No need to hunt for a good parking space, the best is right there! The home was well stocked and absolutely spotless. We felt safe at all times and would definitely stay there again. Owner communication was spot on and she was super easy to work with. We really enjoyed our stay!', 'Excellent option in expensive Boston!: This property was conveniently located, super clean and very accommodating for three couples leaf-peeping in New England. Be sure to check out the Donut King down the street!', 'Excellent property in Quincy: Great property in Quincy. Very clean and roomy just as described has all the facilities you can want. Easy to get into Boston via the T nearest 15mins away then 30mins to heart of Boston. Great interstate access in a few minutes. Locally the Sly and Fix was superb good food and local beer. Would recommend for a stay if visiting Boston but wanted the ease of not being in downtown', 'Gorgeous place very clean: Walking distance to Chinese food, 7-11, liquor store. Hone was super clean, including slippers for you to wear in the house to keep floors spotless. Only complaint was there were 7 of us and there was only enough dinner plates for 4 so we had to eat out of cereal bowls. Really wasn’t a big issue since we were eating Chinese food.', 'Very clean townhouse with easy access to Boston and local attractions.: First time to Boston area, traveling with husband and two adult sons. Rental process was easy. We needed more space than a hotel room for a week stay and loved having a relaxing place to spread out and rest after a busy day of sightseeing. House was clean and comfortable and gave us great access to Boston. This location was perfect for easy drive, day trips to Providence, Rl, Cape Cod, Ma, New Hampshirite, Connecticut and York, Maine. Allowing us to visit 5 states with each being less than a 2 hour drive from this rental. Would love to visit again. Great rental with easy rental process and responsive host. We loved our stay!', 'Great house with very convenient location: The house is very nice and spacious. Had everything we needed and a fully stocked kitchen. Close to the interstate, shopping, and restaurants. Only complaint is the parking. Only one spot is allowed (not an issue for us) but it is a very tight area with other parked cars around.', ""Fantastic gorgeous place to stay!: This was an amazing place, and Jenny was so helpful when we needed her.

It also lacked some of the basic necessities we've found in other VRBO properties such as kitchen products, dishwasher detergent, pots\\u002Fpans\\u002Fbaking sheets, a working coffee maker, extra towels and blankets. This is a 4-story unit with the laundry on the basement level. If you're using the upper floor, there are two full flights of stairs - good to know if anyone in your party is older or you have young kids. The single bed shown in pictures 11 & 36 on the top level is a child's bed, not a twin and not suitable for an adult. It is nice that the homeowner provides a pack-and-play for infants. The linens and pillows were fine. There are very few closets - we hung our jackets on the kitchen chairs. The mattresses are thin. The property is on a busy road; noise from the road bothered some of our guests. A heads up to future renters - there is an auto body shop adjacent to the house. DO NOT park in their parking lot. We arrived late at night and needed extra parking since we had 3 cars (there is 1 parking spot in the rear of the property). We could not find nearby street parking. Eight o'clock in morning, the police had been called along with a tow truck to remove the car we parked in the lot. There are no signs and we did not realize this was private property. This was our error, but it is good to know if you are renting, not to park in the lot. We rented this property because we needed a place close to downtown Boston. At no fault of the property owner, we were surprised by the Boston traffic. The property is \\u003E15 min. outside of Boston, but the drive ranged from 35 - 60 depending on the time of day.

Bath sponges left in showers, but I wouldn't use since they could have been used by previous guests. I messaged host and there seemed confusion between what a wash cloth was. She suggested we use kitchen(?) towels or call cleaning company to see if they could help. I didn't think that was my responsibility, but she said she was out of the country, so I called the number she provided. I couldn't understand the message. I went downstairs to the laundry room where I found damp sheets and towels (from the previous guests?) hanging on a stand. I went through those... again, not my responsibility... where I found 2 more washcloths. Now I have a total of 3 bathing wash cloths for 5 adults. Not good.

We had a late flight and communicated that with the owner. They were very clear on how to get to the property and it was super easy to get access.

My only suggestion is if staying there, bring ear plugs - there are quite a few roosters loose in the area and you are directly in the flight path for Miami, so there is lots of plane noise."", ""Horrific: The property was in an area I'd call a ghetto. We felt incredibly unsafe. There were bars on the window. We arrived after dark and were too scared to go out for dinner. We thought we would order in but there was no internet and after 2-3 phone calls with the property manager the issue wasn't resolved.

We just went to the restaurant close by and had our late lunch and wait until 4pm. When we get there at 4pm the front desk people won't check us in and give us the room key 🗝️ because we book through VRBO. They only check in the people that book through other sites as hotel. It's confusing I know. So part of the hotel own by one company and another part own by different company. I guess my part of the unit that I stayed doesn't have well communication with the front desk people. so I called the number they give me, she picked up and said the manager is around, he will be here soon. Wait and wait. 30-40 minutes later he showed up and talk to the front desk people. They supposed to check me in but they didn't know. And it happened to many people same problem just like me as their mentioned in their conversation. Overall it's a good stayed as long as they smooth out the check in process.

Besides this the location and the apartment was great and close to everything that you need.', 'Where do I start: First of all. I hope you really listen and take heed to this review. When I booked it I asked if I can check in earlier because I had to check out of another property the same day. I was told that if the unit wasn’t booked for that day then yes but for extra $50. Ok no problem but when I start texting and messaging on VRBO I never got an answer back. I continued to message all the way up until the day to check in and I finally called the number that they gave in a message that was since before we checking in. Which was really to only message received. The person didn’t really understand English and told me that he didn’t get any of the messages when clearly it said on my phone that the person read the message. He also said that he is not the only one that had the phone which I find hard to believe and nobody didn’t get my messages. We get to the place after 4 because I called back to see if we could check in and he said yea which he said earlier he would call me to let me know if we could check in at 2pm. Never got a call or text or nothing. Get there and the door is open which they said should be and no key to lock the door. I called him and he said give him a minute…. WHAT I thought the key should already be in the room. Ok he comes give the key my husband ask about the air that is on when it’s already 40 something degrees outside and he said give it a minute. Ok then asked about the cable and it’s not cable just Netflix’s on them but didn’t really work. Ok we went out to eat and came back and tIt was now an ice box with the temperature being on 90degree…. We sleep with our clothes on . Finally my husband turned the air or heat off and it was warmer that way and we were able to go to sleep. I said all that to say that I wanted to be detailed. DONT BOOK YOUR STAY WITH THEM EVER AT THE CLUB AT BRICKELL…. If you want to be disappointed then go right ahead. I wish it was also a way to upload the pictures that I took. Let me explain them…. Small hole in ceiling looks like where the water sprinkle suppose to be. The toilet paper holder is not there. They had the used toilet paper rolls on the back of the toilet. The remote control didn’t have a back to it. It was dusty and had cracks all around the bottom of the walls. The beds are very low maybe for a child to sleep in. The floor is slippery and the balcony had air coming from it closed.I’m sure I’m forgetting something. I asked for refund and they told me no and wouldn’t even accommodate.', 'Beautiful, clean, great location.: Absolutely loved my stay here actually meant to extend it and didn’t in time!

The second room : Queen bed ….. air mattress….Living Room: SofaATTENTION THIS IS  IMPORTANT:This is NOT just a hotel. This is an exclusive Mid-Rise luxury Building in the middle of Wynwood area. Before you book please read my rules:❗️❗️A refundable security deposit hold is  required for ALL reservations. The hold is lifted/ security deposit is returned once you have checked out, keys and garage transponders have been confirmed and nothing is missing or damaged during your stay and the major rules listed aren’t broken you will receive your full security deposit back. This is to ensure a more suitable environment and also a smooth stay for yourself and  all of our guests to come. 🔑🗝The Check-In is unorthodox. You will not be checking in at the lobby, as you will meet with a host or worker. So you may not bother anyone in the building. For liability purposes we consider our guests as friends. This is because short term rental has a stigma attached due to bad experiences with guests over the years having parties, noise complaints, bothering people etc . This is to ensure the Residents and employees will not be bothered. This is a small price to pay however for the quality of building , location and amenities you will  have. If you are uncomfortable with this then do not book. This building is as nice or nicer than any 4 or 5 star Hotels in the area . It is a luxury building.I prefer Professionals, Quiet People, Long Term that will respect the community and not bother anyone.🚭 NO smoking anywhere on the property and NO bringing marijuana to the property.

Walk in shower, nice little kitchen set up, plenty of space for clothing, iron, iron board, dishes, etc. My host, Omar was definitely on point, nice guy too!!Gracias por todo!', 'Uncomfortable: I checked in and got settled, only to realize the place was not thoroughly cleaned… There was Comet still sitting in the toilet and no brush to clean it with, so I went to the store and purchased one… I had to buy several cleaning supplies to be comfortable. The host’s idea of a sponge and soap for dish cleaning, was an old, moldy sponge with an opened Tide pod on it… I bought sponges and dish soap on my own because when I asked the owner for these items, he left me a bottle of Cascade to use in the dishwasher that didn’t exist. This unit only has a sink for hand washing dishes. There is a tree out front that drops these type of seeds that would fall and get stuck on my shoes. I had a rental and my rental ended up smelling awful due to the residue getting mashed into the carpet. The unit also reaked of this smell because there aren’t any proper feet mats to wipe your shoes on so you’re carrying it all inside and it gets everywhere. I got a broom and mop with shammies and Fabuloso to keep up with the smell and dirtiness from the tree droppings. The shower does not have a guard for water coming out onto the floor so I had to use the flat sheet from the bed to keep it semi dry around the shower in order to avoid a puddle… There weren’t enough towels or a shower rug to help. I would dry the sheet after every shower as to be able to use it again… I can’t forget to mention the various roosters that start cawing at 3am and don’t stop till sunset… Needless to say, I didn’t get much sleep… These rates should be significantly lower for the quality of the unit. Just a couple blocks away is a community of vagrants, which is intimidating. I would only recommend this place if there aren’t any others available in the area… Travelers BEWARE!', 'La Casa De Luz: Loved the property, the property manager and Miami! Great, welcoming stay. Thanks!', 'Okay: It was okay , do a little more cleaning in the property! Also a lot of cats and chickens, roosters as well outside the property, Miami was great', 'The worst stay.: Toilet, fridge, floor, kitchen are completely dirty. Some hairs on bed sheet. I had to buy new sheet and replace it.Very loud neighborhood and not modern at all. Chickens, yes chickens and cats making noises 4 am in the morning. Could not sleep. And many things.

I was so nervous. Overall the inside of the house was very clean and looked like the pictures. There’s 3 doors to go thru before you get into the building. Which is great because it’s definitely in the ghetto. We had a car so it was easy to get to all locations easily and the few times we did take a Uber )because Miami parking is not great)was there for within 5 min..... ONLY SMALL ISSUES IS THERE WAS A LOT OF ANTS ON THE WALL IN THE BATHROOM ... no matter how many we got rid of the next day they was back again', 'Unpleasant stay!: Mold smell throughout the building, sketchy neighborhood, cockroaches seen! No Dinning Table! And toilet only a few inches from shower door!Not worth the money! We left 2 days prior and never heard back from the manager!', 'Not safe to stay !!: The gate does not work so you can open it at any given time the neighborhood is very sketchy some children stole a car across the street in the news were out there reporting a crash that ran into the house on the news the police state outside all day long and blocked all of the rules off it was absolutely a headache some thing that I never would have expected from these pictures looking at this listing my children were not comfortable neither was my family I don’t recommend you staying here at all also when you reach out to Maria she does not respond when I sat in the chair outside I fell through it and hit my head on the table do not stay here or trust these people I now have a back injury from sleeping uncomfortable ugly for a week at this apartment the people that stay here are very weird', 'Not a great experience: A property management company owns this building which has a few units inside. The walls are not very thick so we heard quite a bit of noise from the stairs and others during our stay including a strong marijuana smell from someone smoking in the unit below. Everything looks nice on the outside but the amenities are not of quality. We had an easy check in and thought the neighborhood was a little sketchy so didn’t feel comfortable walking our dog - there was a ton of glass outside smashed from what looked like a long time ago and just recently which we made the mgmt company aware and we’re worried about our dog stepping on glass or cutting her paws but nothing was done. There were two bedrooms in our unit but only one set of sheets - one fitted sheet and blanket on one bed and a top sheet used as a bottom sheet for the other. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. The waterfall shower head sprayed water everywhere luckily the handheld one worked fine but was very low pressure. We had an issue at the start of our stay when we heard a loud chirping of the smoke detector in the living area. Low and behold there was no battery inside. We told the mgmt company and they said no problem we’ll work on the issue. We reached out 2-3 more times and after a week also asked for a broom and dustpan and simple cleaning products to tidy up since we were staying for another week. Even though they responded - none of our requests were dealt with so for 2 weeks our safety was in danger for lack of battery in the smoke detector and we were constantly pressing the silence button every few hours which was especially aggravating during the middle of the night. This place looks good but no nice touches and even though they communicated they didn’t solve any issues we raised. Would not stay again.', 'Amazing stay!: It was a great experience to stay at! Very close to any location in Downtown Miami, the host stayed communicating all the time for any questions to be answered, very polite and awesome communication! Overall the place was beautiful, don’t go by the neighborhood, it’s very peaceful and secure.

The yard is absolutely amazing as is the outdoor kitchen. Check-in was very easy and Marc’s instructions were impeccable.

Thanks again Marc!!', ""Beautiful house, great pool, excellent location!: Marc provides not only a gorgeous rental property, but a whole experience. From the beautiful furniture to the comfortable beds to the fluffy bath towels, our stay was an indulgence in luxury. I will most definitely return and I highly recommend staying at his property. You won't regret it."", 'What a great house in such a perfect location!: This house was so awesome, the kids loved the outdoor space and the heated pool. It has plenty of parking and really nice privacy. The location was close to all the best places to see in Miami! Brickell, South Beach, Wynwood, Coco Grove, and the Gables are close by. The host has exceptional taste and delivered the house in absolutely perfect condition. Easy check in and he let us leave our bags early too! All in all it was the best house we have stayed in by far using VRBO and I will certainly be returning to our new favorite place!Thank you Marc!', 'House was nice: Pros:Location is close to the popular landmark Calle Ocho and little Havana. It’s also 2 minutes from the main highway getting you in route quickly. Access to the house was quick and convenient as well as the remote fence for quick exit and entry without exiting the vehicle and as extra security at night. The house was clean and everything was in working order. Really appreciated the individual Mini-splits in each room allowing different temperature levels per room. The built in speaker system sounded great and we were able to use different volume levels between the living room and lower level sunroom. The highlight to us was the backyard. It was nice oasis away from home. The fire-pit was an excellent addition as it was a bit cool during the nights we stood. The pool was a decent size but we did not use it. Marc was quick with responding prior to our arrival. Cons:Marc mentioned that the previous renters was in their 30\\u002F40’s and destroyed the place, he’d hope we weren’t like them. Okay, anyway. We have a suburban which took a lot of parking space. I could see that becoming an issue with future renters with 2 or more vehicles, especially during exiting. Backing up onto the street was challenging during the day as the gate is right at a traffic light. We returned home pretty late so traffic wasn’t an issue so we were able to back in which helped pulling out during the following days. We could not control the music. So we listen to the radio, luckily it was music we enjoy. One night we played the music just enough to hear it outside with the doors closed. Marc, notified me the following day regarding the “loud” music. We didn’t think it was loud enough for someone to complain. However, Marc did mention that he didn’t think we were too loud which indicated to me that he may be one of the neighbors or was looking and listening through the ring camera in the yard which I covered after the text. The main entrance camera I understand but the back yard is a private area and should not have one. I also get quite time is 10pm… but on a weekend in Miami, let’s be real… that’s early anywhere. There’s no speakers outside which could be beneficial. The fire pit was turned on without Marc’s instructions, (how did he know that?) he said if we broke it it will cost us $3000. The ignition switch is about $100. Our friends own the same one. Marc could use some social skills. His communication comes off as rude and short. Overall our stay was pleasant after.', 'Great house and location: We stayed here for two weeks and had a few issue upon check in- rotten fish smell in fridge and broken fire pit. But both were fixed by the owner. The house is nice- as you see in the pictures. Owner can be pushy and controlling. Wants to lock the thermostat and pool temp.

However that area is open to the public and not walking distance from the unit anyways.', 'Probably won’t come back it was OK: Couple things to note:-Bedroom was much smaller than imagined when advertised as a “house” and “home.” Didn’t expect a condo or anything but I did expect at least a comparable space to a hotel room. -Resort fee of $20 per night is mandatory which was not advertised despite the fact that I had no intention to use the amenities so you are really paying $70 per night. -Moving around in the room was difficult only about 3 ft of floor space from the bed to the walls, barely room between the bed and dresser.-Was also not disclosed that you would have neighbors in the same space as you; the bedroom and bathroom both have doors to the other unit (no knobs just locks). Because it was originally one space, you can clearly hear every single movement from the other side as benign as dishes clattering. -Expected the unit to be on the same property as the resort as that’s what it infers but it’s actually a 5 minute drive.-The bed underneath seemed very dirty like it had not been cleaned in a long time. -Rented this unit for the bath as my wife needs to bathe, but the drain stop did not even fit the tub. That being said, the host did accommodate my request for an early arrival and the room was clean without an unpleasant odor. The bedroom (not bathroom) was clearly renovated recently and the area was safe. The bed is nice but it takes up the entire room. Probably won’t rent again, the missus didn’t like it.', 'Great for a short trip: This was a good inexpensive place for two college students to stay for a weekend. The pool is beautiful and we especially like the lazy river. The convenience of having Publix just a couple minutes away was nice too. However, since another unit is right there (this is like a private bedroom attached to the unit), the people staying there were extremely loud and woke us up everyday. We could hear stomping above us and talking right next to us through the thin wall. The laundry room for the other unit is also right next to the bed separated by a wall, so that was loud as well. The bed was just ok. The unit is also far back in the property so we needed to drive to the pool, it wasn’t within walking distance. However, we thought the cons were worth it for the cost and pool access and would stay again.', 'It was horrible. The place was so small, check in took over an hour. I only stayed 2 days.: Horrible!!!!', 'Good place: It was a nice place, and the club house was cool. Definitely a way smaller place than I had pictured and it can get a bit nosy since there is a room right next to it and the door to the other room is inside the property but other than that it was clean and we had things to do during the day.', 'I enjoyed myself very much!!!: It was a good experience!!!']",2.6,,orlando (and vicinity) florida,"[""1.

We stayed for 8 nights and were only given 4 rolls of toilet paper, one trash bag, one dishwasher pod, and no refills throughout our stay. Luckily the owner communicated this a few days before we left, but it was odd to add those to the packing list. I understand not leaving a lot of extras, but it would have been nice to accommodate based on length of stay or number of people. Also the walls and windows are paper thin so if you are a light sleeper, I would not recommend.

I had to clean that out and send my husband to Publix to get cleaning supplies. I then went into the bathrooms, YUCK! You could tell the floors had not been swept nor mopped. There was a pubic hair on the toilet seat and all over the floors and a black ring on the floor around the toilets. So needless to say, I sent Ana an email about the issues I found in the condo. She responded quickly and said she was in the area tending to an issue in another unit and could stop by. Once she got there, my husband was returning at the same time from Publix with all the cleaning stuff and I walked her through and showed her all the hair, dirty floors and pubic hair on the toilet seat. It was at this point Ana said the hair came from US because check in was at 4:00 and it was close to 10:00 pm at this time! I explained to her that we had just got there because we had been at Universal till they closed then came to the condo and that the hair was absolutely NOT from us. Ana said she could send the cleaning crew back out and I told her \\', 'Great location: Great experience and location', 'Great Location With Some Reservations: This condo was the perfect location for visiting both Universal Studios & Disney (about 20 minutes from each). It’s right next to a Publix grocery store and surrounded by good restaurants. The 3 bedroom worked well for a vacation with our 3 young adult children. The gated community is clean, safe and has nice amenities.The couch was very uncomfortable. It felt like we were sitting on particle board as it was hard with no cushioning (we were trying to watch a football game together). The provided supplies are very sparse — zero coffee filters (unwelcome surprise on Morning #1), 1 trash bag and 1 pod for the dishwasher — for 5 day rental. We had mold growing in both showers, but the remainder of the condo was clean.We tried to reach out to the owners\\u002Fmanagers to request late check out on New Years Day and we got no response (still 48 hours later).

The only downfalls are the immense amount of rules left to follow and the lack of basic necessities for traveling guests.

The kitchen was spotless with plenty of kitchen towels, pot holders and even dish detergent. There is a bright sun room towards the back of the cabin with windows facing the lake....we watched hawks, ducks, herons, crows and many we could not name dive in the lake, perch on the forrest across the lake and nest for the night. We fished in the lake and enjoyed the paddle boat very much. The sun rises over the lake too....very pretty with the morning fog rising. We were not far from Fort Christmas. Well worth the drive....besides the fort there are other log buildings, there are many wood frame homes set up like a village...school house, farm houses and etc. We would recommend this to a friend.

The cottage worked perfectly for our needs; close enough to Orlando to meet up with friends but far enough away to avoid the crazy crowds that come with it. Everything you could possibly need was only a mile or so away and once you turn into the neighborhood you feel like you're in a much more quiet and open space to relax and unwind. We enjoyed taking the paddle boat out on the lake, fishing, and grilling on the back deck and spent most of our time in the beautiful backyard overlooking the lake. The cottage has beautiful natural light with large windows and wood detailing that really make it stand out from other places. It was the perfect size for the two of us, spacious kitchen with all the appliances you could ask for, extremely comfortable beds, and every room was decorated with apparent love. The cottage was beautifully kept with attention to detail and VERY clean. This stood our even more because they do allow one approved pet to stay for only $25 extra a night. Unfortunately our dog stayed behind this time but we expect to bring him with us during one of our trips in the future!

I messaged Joe and he had maintenance come over and rectify the next day. Left ONE garbage bag and ONE pod for the washer. Maintenance took care of all of this at the same time as the towels. The bathtub in the 2nd bath doesn't drain, the shower is terrible. 2nd bath should probably be redone, otherwise everything else in good working order.

Side note, it was NOT on 4th of July or New Year’s, in case you wonder. Now, the negatives:1) We did not receive any communication, confirmation email, property address or check-in instruction till WE reached out the night before taking off to this destination. We first tried calling the phone number provided but nobody answered and the VM was full. Then we finally got in contact with Jeff through Vrbo’s website to provide us with the info. 2) The floors of the house were covered in a dark dust, as if you walked into an open-door restaurant in Manhattan, that stained everything that came in contact, from my dog’s paws to our luggage and anything else in between. The rugs and runners around the house were, as expected, also stained with this dark debris (or just dirty, it didn’t stop to check). I also found some sort of large bed cover inside the washer machine that smelled like cat urine (and No laundry detergent anywhere in the house). 3) Cockroach – there were several juvenile live roaches found crawling around the bathtubs, laundry room, inside the dishwasher! We had to sleep with all the lights on to try to avoid waking up with roaches on the bed. To their defense, there were cracks between the ceilings and the walls, all around the house; understandably hard to keep pests out. 4) The backyard did not have a volleyball net, but only a deflated ball around the bushes. There were pieces of glass and other debris that made the yard unsuitable\\u002Funsafe to let your pet (or other children) loose. Multiple areas with dog feces around the yard from previous residents. Only 1 garbage bag, no replacement bags, which did not help... 5) Lastly, the guest bathroom had a small leak coming from the back of the toilet, that we noted only after we tried to flush the toilet. Needless to say, we had to close the outlet valve leading to the tank and mark that bathroom out-of-order.', 'Filthy floors: Space was fine, but floors were not clean. All of our socks turned black just walking from the kitchen to the bedrooms, and we had to buy new socks and wear our shoes.

They also enjoyed the water park which was only a short walk away. While we enjoyed our stay there were a few things to note. The toilets were horrible at flushing…didn’t matter what went in it took two or more flushes. The fridge was slightly cool at best…with it set on its coldest setting. The downstairs bed was very uncomfortable according to the person who slept on it. The AC would randomly switch to heat and be set to 80 + degrees. This was incredibly uncomfortable when getting home from a park day and walking into a 90 degree house. The pool area could use a good sweeping and probably a vacuum of the pool itself as one of my kids cut their toe on the bottom and the other said it was sharp on the bottom.

When I reached out to the property manager, she said the guy had just left and to give it time to cool down. I didn't understand why he was just leaving at 9 or so in the evening and her response was it's Sunday and it's mother's day. I get it, but I would think when you are renting property and you have people staying with it being so hot out, that it would be a priority to fix it as soon as possible. That was half our trip spent in uncomfortable conditions in the condo. I feel like it would have been nice if we were offered a small refund for our inconvenience, but we weren't offered anything. We had a couple other issues, but she was helpful fixing those. Also, we feel we were charged way more for an extra one night then we should have been. We asked a week or so before our stay if we could stay an extra night. There was no one else booked after us. We had to pay part of the owner's fee again. That fee is for cleaning and what not, I don't feel like we should have had to pay that again. The owner's fee is one charge per stay. (Due to a family emergency, we weren't even able to stay the extra night. 🤦�). But like I said, the condo was nice. I loved that it had two King beds.

You are steps from the pool/clubhouse and many of the fun amenities Windsor Hills has to offer.Windsor Hills is a gated resort with a double, Olympic-sized, zero-enty,  heated pool which features a large hot tub on the main pool deck.  Adjacent to the pool is a new water park/splash pad that also features both dual, 3-story water racing slides and an area with smaller slides for the younger ones.

This was my first time being able to take my kids out of town so it was important that everything went well and it did. Everything about this house was PERFECT. If I could I’d give this place a million stars it was A great stay. When I book my next trip to Orlando I’ll be looking to stay at this location again. This IS A MUST STAY!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️', 'Lots of Room: The house was nice. Needs a good deep cleaning. The bedrooms were a good size. We enjoyed our stay. The pool was nice. But lights in the pool did not work. Also there needs to be a few extra towels. There were no washcloths at all. Owner was very nice and helpful with all questions. Over all at was very enjoyable', 'Super cozy: Very clean, cozy, spacious and an overall experience.', 'Disney Vacation: This property location was excellent. It is a short distance to Disney not far at all. We had issues with the television downstairs that would cut off and on. Also, when we arrived the pool was dirty and was cleaned the day before we left home. Otherwise, no other issues.', ""Not all we had hoped for.: Location of the property was good. Community amenities were good, however the pool gets very busy, plan to bring your own lazy river tubes as they are not provided. Several things at the house were not up to our standard and when we wanted to send photos of issues there was no ability to do that. The owner only communicates through the VRBO messenger which does not allow photo sharing. Specifically, I had to put the shower door back on track myself and remove a screw that was in the garbage disposal and sounded horrific. (both minor and not a big deal) The towels supplied were 2 per bathroom and 4 for the pool with no wash cloths. There are no spoons smaller than a table spoon. The pool seems to not be filtering or pumping enough. Daily we removed something that looked like dirty cotton off of the bottom of the pool and it had a dirty yellow ring around the bottom that only cleared on the one day someone came and added chemicals, Trash service was great as it was removed daily but the holding bench was nasty and seemed to have rodent droppings covering the bottom. Top track on the dishwasher was missing a wheel so you have to carefully balance it when loading and unloading and the door didn't open and close properly. I think the screw from the garbage disposal might be from holding the dishwasher square in the opening that makes it rub on the cabinet. Several small issues that we didn't expect for the price and were disappointed when we couldn't let the owner know privately how they may be able to give a better guest experience. Overall great vacation but would not stay here again as there are so many other options in the same area."", 'Great option for large groups\\u002Ffamilies: This place was perfect for our family of four, and both sets of grandparents. Great location. The community pool was spectacular and a nice respite for our day off from Disney parks. Really had no major complaints, and anything we needed to be looked at or fixed, the host was right on it.Two things of note: 1. The neighbors next door (presumably renters) were excessively loud on multiple nights of our stay. Screaming and playing loud music in the middle of the night (2am, 3am). And I didn’t feel comfortable calling the police on them due to the fact that this wasn’t my home.2. The water pressure and shower head (especially in the Master downstairs) left something to be desired.

They had no vacancy to put me in another room so my choices were to stay as is or find a completely new place to stay. We decided to stay in hopes they would finish. That was the wrong choice. It was noisy because of lifts, smelly because of paints, and unsafe because of equipment everywhere! The property owner did very little to help. He hardly replied to multiple emails, texts, or calls. I had to do everything on my own to complain to the resort. The resort admitted their mistake and refunded all of the points used by the property owner for the booking. The property owner and I are currently disputing the amount I should be refunded. The property owner refuses to give me a full refund even though the resort gave me a letter stating they will return ALL of his points.

As other reviews have stated, the unit is small, but just fine for a couple - and the view and location make up for the size. We used the chairs, cooler and boards for our time on the beach - which was a quick easy walk. Fun to watch the beach volleyball and there were lots of places to grab something to eat before we found our patch of sand. We had to do the Diamond Head hike after looking at it out the window! We got a parking spot and it was a bit tight but we’re glad we had a vehicle to do several tours around the island. We didn’t cook at the unit but it was great for breakfast and snacks. Had no trouble finding places for dinner - at most a 15 minute walk. Checkin and the front desk was good. Steve checked in a couple times to see if we needed anything - but there were no issues at all. It is an older building and a petite place - but you’re not there for the room - you’re there for Oahu! Loved our stay!', ""Incredible View and Met Our Needs Perfectly: This room worked perfectly for my short visit. The check-in process went very smoothly, and I appreciated the detailed email before my arrival and the follow-ups, too. The view was everything I love about Waikiki and more: the zoo, Diamond Head, lots of green, and being close to the water. The location is perfect for renting a Hui car and ordering an Uber car or meal. This room was a great place for us to sleep and recharge. The room was small, but that's just what we wanted. The photos do not do the view justice; it's genuinely incredible."", 'Little piece of paradise!: We loved our stay with Steve as host! From booking until final checkout, the process was easy - he checked in a few times to see if we needed anything or if the property needed any attention. The location of the property is perfect if you want to explore Waikiki area and it’s easy to navigate in\\u002Fout of to go explore the rest of Oahu. The best part is the views from your balcony! Perfect view of diamond head and you do get to see some ocean\\u002Fbeach, you can even see the Waikiki fireworks from the balcony or go to the top floor and have a prime viewing spot. 10\\u002F10 recommend booking with Steve as he is an attentive host and makes the process so easy.', 'Little smaller than it looked: Very clean. Bed was comfortable, but pillows were not. Nicely equipped kitchenette. Bathroom very small and would have been tough had my girlfriend joined me. Location was perfect. And Steve the property manager was Johnny on the spot and very welcoming.', 'Couples Getaway: This was our first stop while vacationing in Oahu. The location was amazing and the views from the balcony was perfect, watching the sunrise over diamond head was beautiful. Walk across the street to the zoo or down a block to swim on the beach, everything is so close. The check in was easy and hosts were helpful. The building was very nice but the pool was less than impressive. The room was comfortable and clean but not as remodeled as I thought it would be and it was smaller than the pictures showed. I would still 100% recommended this room, just want anyone that reads this to come in with accurate expectations. Thank you for letting us stay, it was great!', 'Perfect location!: Our stay was perfect! We were close enough to Waikiki to walk to everything we wanted to do, yet on the 9th floor, we had a beautiful view of the ocean on one side and of Diamondhead on the other. Our first morning we walked to the beach and had an incredible morning swim! There was a bit of traffic noise, especially Friday and Saturday night, but it truly wasn’t bad, and I actually kinda enjoyed it. It died down relatively early, regardless. The room was exactly as described, and the owner had even made sure to have the air on for us and have the room cooled off for us when we got there. The room is small, but honestly it was bigger than some of the reviews made it seem. If you take a lot of cruises, I think you will find it bigger than your stateroom. The mattress was comfortable, and the linens were nice, too. The owner even reached out to us a few times to make sure we were being well taken care of. The staff at the front desk was super helpful and friendly. I would 100% recommend this stay to anyone who wants to be in the heart of the action, but still have a great view!', 'Great location: While this is a small room, the friendliness of the property staff, the fantastic views from the lanai and the great location made our stay just perfect. The kitchen is equipped so that eating in is always possible. The sunrises over Diamond Head were great - with a cup of Hawaiian coffee on the lanai! Location made walking Waikiki very easy. Available parking at a reasonable price was also a bonus. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly. We did not have time to use the hotel facilities made available, so we can’t comment. Steve was so professional in all communication. And he is a thoughtful and considerate host. We were celebrating our 50th anniversary with our trip to all 4 major Hawaiian Islands. Steve provided us with celebratory champagne. A nice touch. Great stay!', 'Perfect setting for Waikiki: Location location location!!! This condo is right on the edge of all the hustle and bustle of Waikiki beach. The beach is a quick walk across the street and the view of diamond head is stunning. We walked to dinner along the beach every night. The best part of this condo was Steve! He checked on us three different times during our short stay to make sure everything was going well.

But the location is marvelous: right across the street from the zoo and also from Waikiki Beach. Lovely view of Diamond Head without a forest of sky scrapers--just trees and birds. The tenth floor rooftop offers grand views for sunrise and sunset, with small tables and chairs. The parking garage charges less than most Waikiki hotel garages. Just watch yourself in the basement garage. Very steep ramp. All in all, it served us well.

The review was incredible.: Easy to book. Great communication and excellent responsiveness.', 'Good room .. just a Leaking AC: It was a good room and good communication. The biggest downside was the leaking A\\u002Fc unit. Which is right next to the bed . So every time the unit leaked it would splash on us. To soak up the water We put down the plush towels and were given (as we were told ) and given hard thin towels as replacements. After the second day of the ac leak it started smelling like mildew and started making the stay a bit more difficult excuse if the lingering odor. It’s hard to tell who your talking to when you use the app and call.. there’s a bit of a disconnect between the two so it was hard to figure out who I was talking with and if they had all the info about what was going on. It was a good thing we had tons of activities planned , otherwise the smell would have made the last 1\\u002F2 of the stay difficult.', 'Good place to stay, needs some attention though: Overall good place to stay for location in Waikiki, access and view of the beach, easy check in process, property manager responsive and helpful, Ilikai Hotel has a nice lobby and deck area for lounging, great area to go for a walk to the beach, decent stores in hotel and nearby. Room itself is ok, dishes, pots and pans, kitchen tools are good. The room smelled a bit musty upon arrival, wall paper starting to come off in a couple areas, at times there was an “old” smell but with opening the lanai door and getting air it would make it better. One area of the ceiling trim needs attention, paint peeling and wood looking bad, carpet felt grimy, bottom of bathroom door paint chipping and wood starting to chip as well, not enough trash bags, paper towels or toilet paper for a 4 night stay. Trash chute and laundry located conveniently on the same floor by the elevator. Donʻt forget you donʻt get service from the hotel so youʻll have to dump your own trash and wash your bath towels if you have an extended stay as well as your sheets is they get dirty there are no replacements. Bring your own soap, shampoo and conditioner as well. Kitchen is great, full size fridge and stove, microwave, coffee pot, toaster and rice cooker was nice and on the newer side. So if you are okay with not having amenities or service like a hotel stay and taking care of those things on your own, and not picky about the decor or look of your room, then renting this place is good. If you want a modern and fresh looking and feeling place this isnʻt the one for you. We needed a kitchen more than anything else and the view and location of this unit made it an even better choice for us so we were flexible on the other things.', 'Great view and location: Short walk to the beach. Great view from the balcony. Location was perfect and parking was easy. We had an issue with the AC leaking so we had to keep the sliding glass doors to the balcony closed the entire time. Overall good experience!', 'excellent location: the room we stayed in was very dated. the location is perfect and would stay at Ilikai again.', ""Beautiful unit and great location!: I absolutely loved this unit and its location and the beautiful view of the ocean was exactly what I was looking for. It was clean, quiet and very peaceful. The property manager was very friendly and responsive. My only complaint is that the kitchen supplies are extremely meager so don't plan on truly cooking here. You can heat up some basic foods but there is not enough provided to do much more than that. In addition, I would highly recommend to the property manager to invest in even some low cost pots and pans, as the teflon was totally scraped off, and ESPECIALLY replace the completely rusted out sheet pan. For the price guests are paying to stay here, I think that is a reasonable request. Other than that, I would highly recommend this unit to anyone!"", 'Rm 638 Ilikai: Property is a little tired. The drapes do not meet and the window faces east, so we had to comshaw something to make room dark. Carpets not too clean. The kitchen was adequate, but the hotel was crowded and restaurants at 50%, so getting someplace to eat was difficult - not the issue of VRBO, I recognize. We would likely choose elsewhere to stay in future. Have to say, the bell staff was great! Mahalo.', 'Great value: Overall experience was good. The price was right. The checkin was simple. The key coded front door worked well which other vacation rentals should also incorporate. The kitchen had everything we needed, though some new pots\\u002Fpans, and cooking utensils would be beneficial. The view is a great mix of skyscrapers and the ocean. The sound of the waterfall fixtures across the street below added to a pleasant experience. I’d stay again.', 'Great location: Cozy place to stay for a family of 4 and you can see the fireworks from the room. Room was clean and it even had chairs and an umbrella for the beach.

Everything was perfect NO ROACHES!! AWESOME!!  I did notice that for our 10 day stay, that there were only a few kitchen garage bags in the trash can which it would've been nice to have it supplied with the amount of days of my visit (10) days.  And there was only 4 rolls of TP which should've had at least a week supply.  And last visit in June 2021, I recommended a portable cart for 'us traveling visitors renting your unit' to be able to use a cart to transfer groceries from vehicle\\u002Fgarage to 992 unit.  It is very hard to carry bags of food to the unit being such a distance from garage to end unit.  I am hoping next time I stay, you'll be able to purchase a cart for your unit.  (It is too hard to bring my own cart from CA for each visit.) My daughter stayed at unit 1294 during my visit and I noticed that that condo was well equipped with a couple of fans and beach amenities which tourist would appreciated to have available for use.  Rather than keeping the AC on during night at 992, it would've been nice to have a fan available.  Otherwise, the unit was perfectly clean and no complaints!!! I would've stayed longer on this visit but when I went to reserve online it was already reserved.  So I had to checkout on Sunday 11\\u002F6 and stay at a hotel until Monday 11\\u002F7 departure.  Was sad to leave 992 as it feels like a second home away from HOME!  Thank you, Jerry, appreciate your renting your unit to me!!  I will be back!!!

Uber seems to find the property better if you just put in The Chart House which is on the corner. Also, surprisingly good happy hour meal there! If you are staying any length of time, I would get to a more affordable grocery store and stock up rather than hitting ABC stores which are stupid expensive. The space, again, was clean and comfy and communication was excellent.', 'Wonderful stays: We were here for nine days and had beautiful time here at unit 992 like usual. I believe this was our third time here at this unit and very satisfied', 'Family friendly: This property was the perfect home away from home in Hawaii. It was walking distance to the beach, had all cookware imaginable and it was comfortable after a long day. Spacious enough for our family of 4 and the views were breathtaking. We really couldn’t ask for much more. ABC store across the street provided things we needed and we had Walmart deliver groceries which was super cheap. The bus is across the street for convenience and of course UBER is easy transportation to everything. If you hire a van taxi driver for the day, they will give you a tour of the island and stop wherever you want which is cheaper than an island tour on the bus if you have a group with you.']",4.4,,honolulu hawaii,"[""1.

The pictures are staged and a bit misleading from what's really in the apartment. The place just lacks attention to details.

The beds were comfortable, including the sofa bed and it was very clean. Note that the property lacked certain supplies that should be customary at a rental, including coffee filters, sugar, cooking oil, salt and pepper, to name a few. We ended up buying those items and leaving them at the property. We ran out of toilet paper towards the end of our stay and were told they only supplied two rolls of TP per stay. This just seemed chintzy to us, coupled with the total lack of basic kitchen staples that most every rental we've stayed in has always provided. The chairs they provide are camping chairs (not beach chairs) and there is no beach umbrella or cooler for your use, so take note and be sure to rent those from Snorkel Bob's. In addition, on our first night we tried to leave the rental to grab dinner for the evening and realized our door wouldn't lock. It was supposed to lock automatically behind us. We realized it would randomly lock after a few minutes but then when we entered the code it wouldn't unlock. Thankfully one of us was still inside when we tested it so we didn't get locked out. We were afraid to leave because we'd be locked out. We called the 24 hour line and the woman who helped us was quite rude, made it seem like it was our fault (user error), and we spent 45 minutes on the phone with her before she agreed to send someone out to take a look. Our plans were ruined for the evening at that point. Once that person arrived she confirmed everything we had already told the lady, that the lock was working only sporadically and needed replacement. A simple apology from the woman would have gone a long way for our inconvenience since we ended up staying in & eating snacks for dinner, but none was ever offered during our stay. Despite all of this, we still loved staying here because the views were truly spectacular. Do note that the winds can be very loud (like howling winds) and the building is old so there is air that seeps through the windows, which can keep you up so bring white noise. Also, be careful because these winds can create a suction and cause the front door to slam shut especially if you have the balcony slider open. Since this rental is run by a realty, we just felt it lacked the personal touch that a rental being managed by its own owner would have. No guide to the island, lack of supplies or warm welcome."", 'Great location with nice view: We enjoyed our stay at the Waikiki Banyan. Though the building is a bit dated, it is clean, secure and well-managed. The location is very convenient, right on Waikiki beach.

Being on the 37th floor helps give the great views.-All the furnishings are brand new and beautiful amenities as well.

The property managers advised me to pay for the night for the public parking spot and they will reimburse me for that. I was assigned a different parking slot the next day but I did not receive the reimbursement. After entering the suite, we found out that the bathroom floor is partially flooded due to leakage of the biddet hose of toilet. Since it was late in the night, I just put the hose in the bowl so it does not continue flooding the floor.The toilet was also very old and slow flushing. You need to flush very hard for it to properly work.  The chain in the tank disconnected a couple times so I had to fix it myself.Marta came in the morning and just turned off the biddet valve but it was not fixed during our stay.Communication was very poor. There were 3 phone numbers on the check-in procedure sheet but nobody picked up the phone several times when I called them during our stay. We could not find the laundry card and when I finally emailed them, it took them almost 24 hours to get back to me.  I mentioned the toilet issue again but was not addrressed. I sent a follow up text message regarding the laundry card; but I did not receive any response.In summary, it is an old unit with outdated furniture and a bad functioning toilet.

The room was clean and nicely put together. If you are planning on cooking and making meals, there is not much counter space. It was totally fine for us though as we spend most of our time outside. It had the basic essentials of what we needed: plates, utensils and being able to cut fruit (though I think a type of hard cover over the sink would have been helpful) but that keurig was clutch for an early morning start! We also very much appreciated the little snacks left for us during our stay. Jason was responsive to all questions and concerns and was quick to get things fixed that were broken e.g. one of the window shutters were missing the day we arrived and I had mentioned it. My fault for not responding right away as we were already so busy going in and out so I have no doubt it would have been fixed sooner, but it was fixed the following day.

The coffee table was literally falling apart, drawers in the bathroom wouldnt stay closed, etc. The location made it better, but the wait for the elevators was also very inconvenient. Would not stay here again, especially with the strict rules of not getting sand inside, which is pretty hard considering its a block from the beach. Spent alot of time vacuuming.', 'Location was great: The location was great, parking very convenient. The room is right beside the elevator on the 6th floor which also has the pool area. However the apartment is well worn, missing dishes, cutlery, frustrating to need coins to use bbq on deck. The beds were comfortable and for the comparative price, the place worked for our needs.', 'Lots of amenities but could benefit from a little updating: Stayed here for 7 days with my husband, toddler and baby.Pros:-Washer and dryer made things so convenient, they even had detergent and dryer sheets-location.. about 1-2 blocks to the beach or zoo-they allowed an early check in since there was no one staying there the day we checked in which was awesome for my screaming baby-on the same floor as the pool and playground, the pool was under maintenance though which was ok since we mainly wanted to be on the beach-close to the elevator-parking included, never had issues finding a space but we were usually always back before 9 pm-others mentioned issues with the elevator but we were lucky and never had any, a few times we had to wait for another elevator but no big deal-there’s a vending machine with drinks right off the elevator-there’s also a cute little cafe downstairs that had good coffee, breakfast sandwiches and açaí bowlCons:-AC really only cools one area in the living room and the fan provided doesn’t do much, we ended up buying a fan-the couch had about a 1.5 inch metal pole sticking out the side, not safe for the kiddos so we covered it the best we could with a blanket. -the front door was hard to keep locked. Like someone else mentioned we did manage to find the “sweet spot” to keep it locked-unit definitely could use an update, things seemed to be broken or about to break, lots of markings on pets of the wall and bathroom sliding door, one of the large paintings was missing off the wall. Other things to note:-bathroom is very small, the actual sink area is a good size though very dark. But the toilet and bathtub\\u002Fshower area is small. Something to consider if you’re on the larger or taller side or have to bathe the kids. Also, one of the bathroom vanity drawers would not stay closedOverall, we enjoyed our stay. We had to make some adjustments so that the unit could fit our needs with children but nothing that put a damper on our trip. We can’t wait to book our next trip to Oahu.', ""Very Convenient and Comfortable Stay!: The property owners were extremely quick with their responses to all our questions throughout our stay. The only thing I would say is try to book a room on the lower floors as the elevators were down a lot and we ended up having to take the stairs 90% of the time (some people were having to walk all the way to the 20th floor and higher). Super close to Waikiki Beach. The unit was clean for the most part, but there were some minor stains on the bed sheets and towels. Making sure we don't get any sand in the unit was a bit of a hassle, but we made it work. Bathroom was real small and the beds were decent. The front door was a bit difficult with the lock being loose, but we found the sweet spot that secured the lock in place. All in all, I'd rent this unit again."", 'Enjoyed my stay: It was nice having a washer\\u002Fdryer in the unit. Additionally, the air mattress came on handy.', 'Supply: Having just more toilet paper, cleaning towel for dishes...For the rest everything good.', 'Perfect for what we needed: Great little 1 bedroom condo close to the beach with a\\u002Fc & free parking for a great price. Perfect for our little family. Thanks!', 'Great location, place just ok!: Great location, communication was excellent with the management, the apartment is not bad but needs some tlc and serious update. It is not meant for more than 4 people as the couch in living-room is painful to sit on, let alone to sleep on. Bathroom is so dark and small, door beat up and dirty, electrical plug in the bathroom is not working. It would be nice to add wine glasses in the kitchen cabinets so people can actually enjoy wine the way it’s supposed be enjoyed. Overall it was ok but I wouldn’t go back again.', 'Walking distance!: To Waikiki beachLeonard’s MalasadasGreat location and great host.', 'Extremely convenient location but missing some amenities: This place sufficed for what we needed it for. We basically just were back in the apartment at night for showers\\u002Fsleeping. The location is very close to Waikiki beach (1.5 blocks) which was SO nice and convenient, it was close to a bunch of stores and restaurants, and was on the hotel floor where the pool\\u002Fjacuzzi was located which was again very nice. They do have a lot of items needed in the kitchen if you wanted to cook, but not basics such as salt, pepper, butter, etc. Cons of the place was they only provided a small quantity of toilet paper and 1 garbage bag. When I asked for more, they claimed the check in instructions noted that they provide a small “starter kit” and were responsible for the cost of buying more - I still cannot find that noted anywhere in any of my emails. The bathroom door wouldn’t shut fully. About 1.5 inches was left open which of course makes it uncomfortable to go to the bathroom at all and to shower since the bathroom shower was a clear small one. As well as since it was a sliding door, it was constantly being damaged by the mechanisms inside the wall with each slide. There was also a note saying we would be charged if there was any stains of makeup or blood on towels - basically saying do not be female and you’re fine. Last thing that was a little frustrating is that the AC unit was on the floor and did not fully cool the bedroom.']",4.0,600.0,honolulu hawaii,"[""1. Moana Surfrider: 0.4 mi"",""2.

There was no type of shuttle to this place like alot of the places on that island also you have to walk far to the beach. Other then that it was a very nice stay. The service that was there was amazing. The pool area was amazing. They have free washing and dryers there which was great. There parking was cheaper there then any other place. It was a perfect place to drive from to get to the highway and get to go to other parts of the island. There was a ABC store close by if u needed things also if u have a car Walmart wasn't that far to get to. Very good communication with owner of the place, always answered questions when you needed a question answered.

The room was just right for us. I love the fact of laundry room being free! Would definitely recommend to stay here again. The view is beautiful and for the price we pay I would say I got my moneys worth.', ""Met our basic needs: This is not a fancy property. It had two older double beds. They were not especially comfortable. It has a bathtub that we never used. It has a small vanity area with a fridge, as well as a variety of appliances under the sink such as a hotplate. There are some dishes. There is a small kitchen table in the room with the beds. The place was reasoanbly clean when we arrived. What bugged me about this rental is the following (we lived with it, but the owner should either address these things, or renter beware): Various power outlets do not work properly, and the lamps keep going on and off; the chair on the deck has a big hole in the middle of it; the gym is very tiny in the building and can only accommodate 3 people really; the air conditioner is very loud!; various of the washing machines and dryers in the common area do not work; VRBO users cannot access the media room; it feels like the owners have done the bare minimum to make the place livable - it is in need of updates to the furniture). The room met our basic needs for a couple of weeks, but we felt pretty cramped. The price was right though. Thanks for making your place available. The pool area is really nice and I spent a lot of time there lounging while my daughters slept in. The place is about 500 metres from the beach, and it's a nice beach. There are other really nice beaches within a 15 minute walk as well. There is a very nice outdoor mall a few minutes away with many many stores and lots of restaurants. Parking is expensive. It's valet only ($38 per 24 hour period - they don't do partial days). We found underground parking about 1.5 blocks away that was $24 for 24 hours. There is also on-street parking for $3\\u002Fhr, 2 hour limit. Free on-street parking from 10:00 pm to 6:00 am. Last thing, there was a rooster living across the street that crowed constantly from very early in the morning and well into the day. Every day. There are lots of chickens roaming in Hawaii. They can be very loud. Even though this place was on the 20th floor, the rooster was incredibly loud some mornings and the crowing was constant. Not sure how people here live with that all the time."", 'Do NOT stay here: This place ruined my vacation. The smell of mold blasting from the AC was disgusting, we turned it off and opened the balcony door and tolerated the marijuana which was lit on the next balcony the entire time. There is NO KITCHEN- there is a refrigerator placed in the bathroom closet and a hot plate next to the bathroom sink- attempting to cook there is a joke….washing plates in a bathroom vanity sink is so disgusting, and it caused plumbing issue which resulted in a maintenance man in my room all day and water all over the floor. The smell was musky and gave us all head aches. When l called the “after hours” emergency line to address the backed up plumbing, no call back, l then called again next morning and left ANOTHER message before getting a response. The beds are so uncomfortable- sheets has other peoples hair on them and l questioned if they were even clean, bed covers are too big and drape on the dirty floor- l took pics of what was under the beds- at least 6 months worth of dust, even finger nails.

Check in and check out process was simple and easy.', 'Great Location, clean property: We had a comfortable stay. Property is clean & Marina view is beautiful. Kitchen is new & clean, and the vanity is a good plus for 3 ladies in our fam. Love waking up with a view of Hilton lagoon & Waikiki beach. Hallway & parking is lil outdated but I love the fact that you could park on your condo floor which makes it comfortable for everyone with no need to use the elevator. They have beautiful elevator though & building is just across ABC store & Mc Donald’s. Easy walk to Hilton Village as well. We had used the beach chairs & body board available for guests. Thanks for being a good host!', 'Family vacation: This was nice and in convenient location to get to the beach. We never heard any noise from the restaurant below like other listings say. I would say that the cars that drive by on the road below are sometimes noisy but not enough to cause an inconvenience. The overall appearance in the outside looks nothing like the inside. The place was fantastic, loved the privacy wall and additional sleeping options. Having the separating space between the bathroom and room, living area was nice so others weren’t woken up by bathroom visits. The elevators in this building are very sketchy., a housekeeper got stuck in one for a while and my husband did too but for only 5 minutes. This however, has nothing to do with the unit but good to know since it being on the 3rd floor the stairs were a good choice for me.', 'Damage insurance? Then make sure everything is not damaged!: This is the first time i have had to take out damage insurance at an extra cost and yet the single pullout sofa was damaged and the sheets were stained. The curtain hanger for the curtains to the balcony fell down when we opened the curtain, the floor was dirty, the dishes were dirty, food was mixed with cleaning supplies in the lower cabinets...And if you are located over a pub\\u002Frestaurant, that should probably be mentioned in the description.The master bed was very comfortable and the bedroom nicely furnished.', 'A stunning location and view: We enjoyed the condo for about 2 weeks!we walked to the breach, Waikiki and shopping it was easy and fun! We’ll stay again!', 'Great stay: The property was in a great location. Check in and check out were super easy. The condo was clean and comfortable, had everything we needed. We really enjoyed our stay!', 'Great getaway, but a little noisy: Positives: easy access to different swim spots, enough space for small family or group, all the appliances and utensils you could need, extra laundry soaps and spices, large bed, raised walk way that connects Ilikai marina to The Modern to Ilikai Hotel and down to the street, pack n play\\u002Fhigh chair were provided, toys for kids, lots of beach gear.Negatives: It is quite noisy from the pub, restaurant and marina that are all two floors down. 4 of 6 nights the noise was enough to keep us awake for hours. There were a few base boards\\u002Ftrim that were loose throughout the condo. The bathroom door and door to the vanity would not stay shut. Some updates to the bathroom and storage cabinets would make a nice upgrade. It was the first vacation for my husband and I with our one year old son, which might explain some of the disadvantages of the location. Caution for families with young kids: the noise and distance to beaches can be a complex undertaking for such a short outing with a little one.This is probably better suited to a young group that goes out at night or wants easy access to fishing\\u002Fscuba boats at the marina.', 'Staying near Marina: It was a very nice place and comfortable for 4 people. Friday and Saturday nights are really noisy with the live music and constant traffic of people. The noise travels upward so being on third floor, it is loud. We couldn’t always get the air on so it got a little warm when sun was shining in. One suggestion maybe place a small notebook with instructions for air, TV, and reminder of what needs to be done would be a nice add.', 'Quaint, quiet, complete: not Going to lie, the place is small. But, that was perfect for the wife and I. The bed was amazing. After a long day of travel I collapsed on it and fell asleep instantly. The amenities we fairly basic. But, we didn’t go to Hawaii to sit in an apartment. Talking to locals I found out that the marina is where the SS Minnow started its faithful trip. Actually slowed me down I bit while I googled it. The location is close to everything you want to do. We did not rent a car and I am glad. Restaurants, ocean, lagoon, shops of all varieties. Kept us busy finding new things all day..No complaints on this side. Looking forward to booking this place again.']",4.8,680.0,honolulu hawaii,"[""1. Ala Moana Center: 0.3 mi"",""2.

Kitchen was well stocked with everything you need, and bathroom was ok. The toilet\\u002Fshower is separated by a pocket door, which is good if you need to get ready using the sink\\u002Fmirror, while someone else showers. Overall, the stay at this unit was great, which includes an air conditioner that kept the space cool. The only negative, was the checking in process. The check in office closes at 4pm local time. The listing didn't explain which floor the office was on. We had to go to front desk and get clarification. The office is located on the 4th floor. We had to call an emergency number on a flyer hanging outside the office to get our room number and door code.

First off, the map of the listing is VERY deceiving. Per the map, within the app, it is shows the location to be within the Royal Hawaiian. And if you click “get directions” within the app it actually takes you to the Royal Hawaiian!!!! NOT to where the rental actually is located. It is only a few blocks away but I booked this with the impression of a room on the beach.Secondly, they provided you with the bare minimum when is comes to plates, cups, silverware, soaps, towels, etc. I have stayed in multiple VRBOs across the United States (Nashville, Texas, Colorado, Maui, South Carolina, Arizona, Georgia) and this was by far the worst one my friend and I have ever stayed at.

The kitchen and bathroom floors were dirty and had not even been swept (crumbs and macaroni in the kitchen, hair and dust in the bathroom). The bathroom sink had mould under the faucet. There wasn't any bedding for the hideabed. One of the beds had a small size flat sheet instead of a proper size fitted sheet. Supplies were very limited considering we had booked for 19 days. One small hotel size bar of soap, 2 rolls of toilet paper, 3 garbage bags and no cleaning supplies. The kitchen was also very poorly stocked. Not enough of various items. Only 2 wine glasses, one of which was badly cracked, 2 forks, 3 plates, no plastic storage containers, no dish cloths, one tea towel, no stopper for the kitchen sink. The slicing knives were very dull. There was only 1 electrical outlet in the kitchen, thereby necessitating unplugging to alternate between using the microwave, toaster and coffee maker.Another huge disappointment was that the pool renovation had not been completed. When we made our reservation the completion date was 2 months before our arrival. We like the location and have stayed in other units in this building and have not previously been disappointed. Although the units were older and not updated they were very clean and well equipped. The lobby, elevators and hallways were always very well maintained and clean. "", 'Location is accessible to all walks of Waikiki: PROS: • AMAZING location! 5 min walk to the main beach, restaurants, convenience stores and the main high end shopping strip! • Bus stops are in front of the hotel for easy access to tourist places including Diamond Head Hike, Ala Moana Centre and Pearl Harbor! • Wifi is good quality • Size of room is enough for 4 people to sleep CONS: • Some cockroaches & bugs that have been found running inside the kitchen utensil drawers, therefore place feels unclean • Air con is too loud and disrupts your sleep • Mattresses are too hard & uncomfortable for those that are soft bed sleepers • Not enough refills for toiletries including complementary shampoo, conditioner and soap • 7th floor gym & pool is under renovation so entertainment areas seem limited ', 'Great location: This property is small but met all of our needs. Its a short walk to the beach from the property and there are numerous dining locations nearby.', 'Perfect location near Wakiki: Short walk to everything including beach, shopping, and many nice restaurants. Nice view from the unit. Clean room and convenient (the parking option is very useful for our rental car). The kitchen can be better stocked and we have to buy basics such as salt, pepper, paper products and so on to make basic meals. There is a Safeway not too far away but not sure how to get there without driving. The checkin code was wrong and fortunately got fixed quickly, but it took some back-and-forth.', 'Not as advertised: This suite needs some TLC.1. Carpet needs to be cleaned - there are spots in front of the door and sofa. 2. Kitchen and bathroom floors need a thorough scrubbing - there are food crumbs between the fridge and cupboards as well as the dresser in the living room needs to be moved so that the carpet can be cleaned. I am not sure how much time your cleaning people have and what they are expected to do. 3. The caulking around the tub is very \\', 'Good Location: The location was great for us. Just a short walk to the beach, shops, restaurants, etc. They offer parking for a reasonable fee, but it must be arranged for ahead of time. The condo was a bit disappointing to me. As mentioned in previous reviews, the carpet was dirty (way past needed to be replaced, in my opinion). The pool was closed when we were there, and no one warned us that it would not be available. This was a big surprise\\u002Fdisappointment to us. There were no beach towels. The air conditioner was VERY loud. The kitchenware was sparse— if you wanted to serve a meal for 4 people, you wouldn’t have enough plates\\u002Fcups, etc. If your want a great location and won’t be spending much time in the condo, this could be a good place for you. If you like having a comfortable room, you may want look elsewhere.', 'Horrible: Instructions were not clear on how we’re going to get the keys. There was one line that we had to call that wasn’t working. We had to call a different line eventually they picked up but then stress in Rosedale not clear on how we get the keys. When we arrived the apartment had cockroaches which is disgusting. I highly don’t appreciate the fact that they are charging me an arm and a leg for a loft with two beds but has cockroaches. I could have stayed at the Marriott if I wanted to but my mom wanted a kitchen so she can cook her own meals. I don’t like the fact that they charge us a cleaning fee when we have to take our own trashes and clean after self. We don’t have room service or someone cleaning around on the daily. Also we didn’t have any extra toilet paper or napkins any napkins at all and no trash bags we just have the one trash bag for the little trashcan which is not even enough for a five-day stay. I highly don’t recommend this place do not stay here unless you wanna take cockroaches home and pay for extra stuff that you should already have available to you if you’re staying somewhere for four days plus. I think they should’ve had enough toilet paper is for us enough napkins in the kitchen for us and enough trashbags for us. I also think that they need to get rid of the cockroaches because if the cockroaches were to follow me home I would definitely sue this place for any maintenance I need to do.', 'Good: Good', 'Great Location, good value for money: Considering the swimming pool was out of order and i booked a stay 2 days before we needed to check in, it was good value for money. Convenient and efficient replies from Kahara and was easy to get answers to questions.', '1606 Royal Kuhio: Great location! Close to shopping and beach. Beds are comfortable.

When we arrived, after walking all around the building with our luggage, we could not locate the unit # supplied in the check-in email. Called Burke, no answer, leaving us standing out in the cold in front of the building. When he called us back, he gave us the correct # and stated unequivocally it was provided in his messages to me. I reviewed every one of his emails, VRBO messages and texts. This is simply not the case. I asked Burke if the unit would have ice available. He replied \\"", 'Clean condo, easy rental process.: Very clean. Easy access to DC region. Burke was great. Memory foam mattress was pretty firm, if that is a problem, consider that in rental decision.', 'Great property in Northern Virginia: Had a great visit near Washington DC.

Would loved to have had some kind of guide for dummies (HA! HA!)on using TV. Fortunely, we had a son-in-law close by. We chose this property because of its location to our family in Springfield.
