Executive Summary

One of the key features of operating in online short-term rental businesses is ensuring that both strata of customers operating on the website, i.e. users looking to book a property and property owners wanting to rent their resources, have a pleasant experience. To augment the given use case in hand, we undertook the project to solve it in two halves. First, the project aims to scrape data from VRBO1.com, one of Airbnb's largest competitors, to collect different attributes that determine the pricing for properties, across famous cities in the US such as San Francisco, New York, Seattle, and Texas, among others. Second, the collected data will be used to perform two major sub-tasks: first, developing an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to analyze pricing trends on VRBO.com, and further, using the models to predict the prices of different types of rental properties based on factors such as amenities, number of bedrooms, location of the property, and many more. The second sub-task is to use the algorithms to provide personalized recommendations for owners based on customer reviews, in order for them to improve their property listings for better profitability and increased booking chances. In this report, we will dive deep into identifying our source of data, gathering the required information for our analysis, and finally preparing the data for business readiness.

The business value that we aim to create using this project is to improve usersâ€™ experience and thus boost engagement and popularity among customers. The insights generated from this project in the end will be beneficial for home rental business owners, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding prices and amenities to optimize their rental properties for the market. Additionally, the project's focus on popular tourist destinations in the US makes it particularly relevant for the hospitality industry, as it allows stakeholders to gain valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences. Overall, this project has the potential to contribute to the growth and evolution of the short-term rental market, while also providing significant value to users and industry stakeholders.
